					"PASTRY": [
						"1. If using hazelnuts, go to STEP 1 of the frangipane filling first to minimise washing up.",
						"2. Place flour, sugar (if using maple syrup, add it in step 2), salt, xantham gum (only if you are making a GF pastry) and cubed vegan butter in a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, use a bowl and two knives to cut the fat into the flour (see process photos here).",
						"3. Slowly feed cold water (if using maple syrup use only about 2 tbsp of water mixed in with maple syrup) through the chute while pulsing the mixture. Once the water has been added the pastry should resemble breadcrumbs (see photos in the post).",
						"4. Transfer the mixture onto a work surface. Using your hands, bring it together and form into a disc \u2013 it should nicely stick together, if it\u2019s still too dry and crumbly trickle in 1 tsp of cold water at a time. Handle as little as possible and do not knead.",
						"5. Wrap the pastry disc up in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.",
						"6. Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll it out on a lightly floured surface until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness.",
						"7. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes/or thinner bits with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin.",
						"8. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for another 30 minutes. You can also just leave it in the fridge overnight if making ahead",
						"9. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F (regular, no fan setting). Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads (or dry beans) for a blind bake.",
						"10. Blind bake the pastry for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beads and bake for another 5 minutes \u2013 until cooked and egdes are only pale golden, not browned. Keep the oven on."

					"BLACKBERRY LAYER": [
						"1. Put blackberries into a small pot and set it on low heat stirring until they release juices. If your blackberries are sweet, I recommend adding a bit of lemon juice \u2013 to taste.",

						"3. Once blackberries in the pot have almonst completely fallen apart, trickle in cornflour mixture whilst stirring.",

					]
				},
				{
					"FRANGIPANE LAYER": [
						"1. Grind hazelnuts in a food processor until finely ground, transfer to a bowl, dust the food processor off and go back to the pastry STEP 1.",
						"2. To prepare the filling, cream vegan butter (or oil) and sugar (or maple syrup) with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Add aquafaba, a small amount at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"3. Finally, gently fold in the ground hazelnuts, baking powder, salt and vanilla extract. I also like to add about \u00be tsp of ground cardamom sometimes.",
						"4. Fill the pre-baked (and cooled off) pastry case with blackberry filling.",
						"5. Next, gently spread frangipane filling over the blackberries making sure it reaches all the way to the edges.",
						"6. Decorate the top with blackberries, placing them on top of the filling and pushing them only a tiny bit as the filling will rise during baking.",
						"7. Bake the tart for about 40-45 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

Take off the pan and allow them to cool.",

				"Great recipe! Delicious and worth the time! I've made the filling with your sunflower seeds feta and it worked great.  I'm one of those zucchini growers who's getting tired of having them, but they just keep coming. Luckily you website has loads of zucchini recipes - so thank you Ania!",
				"I've made this dish twice now in a little over a week - it is courgette season after all! The first time I forgot to get some tofu out of the freezer and so used cashews, the second time I remembered the tofu. As ever with a recipe there were minor changes - I had no capers and I was vaguely halving it for two. But both times the resulting meal was delicious. It is a great way of using a lot of courgette in one dish without it being too \"courgettey\". And if you have any of the filling left over and there is still space in the pan going in the oven,  just form balls of mixture and put them in alongside the rolled courgettes. We'll be certainly cooking this one again, at least once more before our courgettes run out.",
				"Reading your recipe, and it sounds amazing! The tofu filling rather positively surprised me, I couldn't think of that myself! Going to make this tomorrow and make a separate slightly change to the recipe for my baby (we are trying to feed him almost the same things as us). I'll let you know how it went! Thanks again, been following your blog throughout the years and several stages life gives me. Student, working, pregnant, baby!"

Place it in the fridge for a couple of hours to thicken.

				"1. Mix the flour, salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl.",
				"2. Pour in water while mixing in with a spoon.",
				"3. Once most of the water has been added, use your hands to bring the dough together, it should all stick together easily without any dry pockets, if there are, add a touch more water but in very small, incremental doses as you don\u2019t want the dough too wet.",
				"4. Cover the bowl with a piece of cling film or a plastic bag and leave on the counter to proof for 18-24 hours \u2013 until it has doubled in size, risen and the surface has little holes. Proofing time depends on the ambient temperature, the cooler it is the longer it takes. An ideal temperature is about 22\u00b0 C / 72\u00b0 F.",
				"5. 45 minutes before you are ready to shape your pizzas, preheat the oven with a pizza stone* in it to 250\u00b0 C / 480\u00b0 F.",
				"6. If you don\u2019t have a pizza peel or are not quite experienced in using one, you may want to place a piece of oven-proof paper underneath each pizza to use as a sling later.",
				"7. Sprinkle the countertop or the paper laid on top of it with regular flour and semolina flour to prevent the dough from sticking.",
				"8. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a pizza using whatever technique you usually use. I like to stretch it with my hands in combination with using a pizza roller. I managed to stretch dough to roughly 22 cm / 9\u2033.",
				"9. Top your pizza with your favourite toppings. I spread wild garlic pesto at the bottom, piled grilled zucchini on top, decorated with cherry tomato halves, chopped capers and dollops of vegan ricotta.",
				"10. Using a pizza peel or the paper sling, carefully transfer each pizza to the oven.",
				"11. Bake each pizza for about 12-14 minutes, until the base is cooked and the crust and the toppings are gently charred."

			"recipe": [
				"1. Soak almonds in cold water for 4-8 hours or overnight. Drain, discard the water.",
				"2. Place drained almonds in a blender with 600 ml / 2\u00bd cups of fresh water. If you are using a small blender, only use as much water as it fits in the blender and add the rest directly to the pot in step 5.",
				"3. Blend until almonds are really finely ground and the water turns into creamy almond milk.",
				"4. Place a nut bag (or a double layered muslin cloth) in the sieve suspended over a medium-large pot.",
				"5. Gradually pour the contents of blender into the nut bag and allow the milk to drain into the pot below.",
				"6. Once most of the liquid drains out, squeeze the nut bag really well to extract as much milk as you can \u2013 you should be left with super dry pulp (see blog post above for ideas to use it up).",
				"7. If using salt, add it to the pot and mix well to dissolve.",
				"8. Bring almond milk to a gentle simmer, until a thermometer registers 85\u00b0C / 185\u00b0F. If you want to expedite the process and not have to simmer it for 20 minutes after adding lemon juice, allow the milk to come to 93\u00b0C / 199\u00b0F instead.",
				"9. Once your almond milk comes to temperature, sprinkle 20 ml / 4 tsp lemon juice on the surface of the simmering milk. Stir gently to distribute the acid evenly. You should see small curds forming after a couple of minutes. If the milk isn\u2019t curdling, add a little more lemon juice.",
				"10. This is the point where you could simply rest curdled milk for 10 minutes and transfer the curds to a mould, but I got a nicer end product by simmering it for another 20 minutes and resting \u2013 see next step.",
				"11. Keep the pot on low heat and aim to maintain 85\u00b0C / 185\u00b0F for full 20 minutes without stirring. Try to keep the milk within 79-88\u00b0C / 175\u00b0F-190\u00b0F range.",
				"12. You should end up with delicate curds by the end of this process \u2013 I found that the separation isn\u2019t always as visually apparent as it is with dairy milk and sometimes the milk just looks thick and creamy but that\u2019s okay the resulting cheese is still delicious. Rest the milk for 10 minutes.",
				"13. Place a mould/moulds on a deep plate so that any excess liquid can drain away. Gently transfer the curds to the mould (see the post for alternatives).",
				"14. Keep in the fridge overnight to set. The longer it sets the firmer it will get, but I find that it needs at least an overnight stay in the fridge to firm up enough to use.",
				"15. Keep ready ricotta in an air-tight container in the fridge, for 5-6 days. It can be frozen, but it will release some liquid once defrosted \u2013 simply drain it away and use. It\u2019s perfect spread of toast/crackers, crumbled on top of pasta/gnocchi/risotto or on top of pizza."

				"Made this recipe & added two spoonfuls of nutritional yeast along with the pinch of salt. It was easy and creamy and so delicious! I\u2019ll make it again for sure. Thanks!",
				"I made this ricotta during the weekend and I'm loving it!  The curds were super tiny so I ended up using my nut milk bag inside of a tofu press to form the cheese. I wonder if that was because I was using a Thermomix where the blades were in motion throughout the whole process and even though they were very slow they broke up the curds? I used the 2nd method of keeping the milk at a constant temperature of 85\u00b0C. I used a Thermomix because it tells me the exact temperature in the pot. I'll try the 1st method next time and will rest the milk + curds.Anyway, it turned into a delicious cream cheese and I can see how versatile it is! Genius idea :)",
				"I'll definitely try again :) I used it all week in sandwiches and then put the leftover on my pizza and it was so delicious!Quick question for next time: What happens if you go beyond 93\u00b0C? Have you every tried?",
				"Can you use almond milk instead of blanched almonds?",
				"I'll bet this ricotta would be great in a pizza. One Chicago pizzeria makes an amazing ricotta-black olive deep dish pizza, and as soon as I saw your ricotta, I thought of that pizza. Some tomato sauce and a little vegan mozzarella (the Chicago restaurant puts the mozzarella on the crust so beneath on the toppings). Yum."

				"6. Finally, stir through chopped white chocolate. You could also fold in raspberries by this point, but I prefer laying them in between the layers of the batter for a more even distribution.",
				"7. Cover the bottom of the baking tin with only a thin layer of cake batter. Arrange raspberries on top, cover with half of the remaining batter, follow up with more raspberries and the rest of the batter. Make sure raspberries are not peeking through the cake batter.",

Some weeks later I was happy I could give it a try and I loved the combination of raspberry , the vegan white chocolate and hint of  cardemom. Big shout out to Lazy Cat Kitchen in general for sharing her love and passion about vegan food. The blog is so well documented, with finger licking good food and  beautiful food photography.",

I had to skip cardamon because I didn't have any and I decided against the icing, although it looks beautiful on the pictures \ud83d\ude42 I actually made 2 of them, one was with ksylitol instead of sugar. Super easy to make, and the taste of white chocolate and raspberries is soo nice! Thank you for the recipe!",

This recipe was one of the best veggie ones I've ever made and the slaw with dressing was a complete and delightful surprise. Must admit to cheating and just using a tub of shop bought guacamole but it was still nice. I also used pouches of spanish grains from the supermarket rather than plain brown rice. I used the 'What the Cluck' chicken substitute and cooked it how Ania suggested and it turned out just perfect. Think this is going to be one of my most used recipes from now on.",

This is the first time in my life that I've ever liked a slaw, and the chicken-style tofu is amazing! And so is the green avocado dressing! I've been using homegrown tomatoes in the recipe, and making lots of other changes, and it is just fantastic!! Thanks very much!!",

Next time I think I'll try it with aubergine instead of courgette and I reckon it'll go well with lots of fresh basil on top :)",

				"Another hit with my meat eating husband \"it doesn't even need cheese on\", praise indeed!",
				"Fantastic recipe!!! Made this for my meat-eating husband and teenage son and both loved it. I used almonds instead of pinenuts and slightly less lemon and nutritional yeast. So flavoursome. Love the tip to use pasta water to reduce the amount of oil. This is definitely a much lighter and fresher vegan pesto which has now taken over as being the family favourite. My son wouldn't normally go for broccoli and couldn't believe it was in the meal.I just discovered your website Ania (your beetroot risotto is on the menu for tomorrow night) but I've bookmarked a pile of the recipes to use the organic seasonal veges from our local market. Thank you!!!",

I can seem to find a way to print the recipes without taking several screen shots and printing from those.

Our dressing was very liquid when we added the sugar/lemon juice (shouldn\u2019t that say lime juice?) - there was no pounding to be done! But it turned out beautifully (with some extra lime juice at the end). I don\u2019t think the lemon grass I bought was very good, it was stringy/tough all the way through (would love to know what it should\u2019ve looked like after bashing!) but by chance I had a tube of lemongrass pur\u00e9e that I bought last year, so added that instead. We also added avocado to the salad at the end (had one open), which was a lovely addition and protein source. So good!",

Because I\u2019m vegan it slipped slowly into the back of my pantry, but your inspiration would help me crack it open. More importantly, I made your salad and it\u2019s stunning. Thank you!

				"The flavour of this mousse is ON POINT!I was so excited when I saw this recipe come into my emails...:) I love lemony sweets, as I love that sweet, sour, tang combo. Anyway.. I realised I didn't have enough cashews left, but I did have silken tofu in the fridge... so I thought Id try it with that... I also usually always want to stick to unrefined sugars, but because I was going to be subbing a major ingredient (cashews for tofu), I decided to use the cheaper caster sugar instead of coconut sugar  just incase it didn't work out!I wasn't really concentrating making this... so I'm not sure if I was supposed to allow the syrup mixture to reduce and thicken..? So, mine was basically complete liquid, just with the sugar dissolved.I mixed it with the tofu, and at first put the same amount of tofu in as it would have been cashews... But I felt it was super runny... so I ended up putting in 300g of tofu (the full packet). Note; as I said, I really wasn't concentrating properly making this!Anyway... the flavour was awesome... so I continued... Whipped the aquafaba to stiff peaks, started combining the tofu lemon mix with the aquafaba, and I was expecting it to just deflafe... But it actually seemed like it was keeping its form! So I put the mix in moulds and put it in the fridge to set overnight. The next morning, the mousse looked amazing..and looked like it had set...and it had, but just at the very bottom, liquid was beginning to separate... But, the top two thirds of the pots, were beautifully lemony, light, tangy, sweet delicious! I think... considering my complete lack of concentration making these.. this might be a pretty fool proof recipe, and I can't wait to make it with cashews...or perhaps reduce the syrup more so it is thicker, and try again with tofu (more cost effective)... Thank you Ania, once again for another beautiful recipe!! X"

						"1. Boil a small pot of water and fill a bowl with cold water. Once the water comes to boil, plunge frozen petit pois (or green peas) into it and cook according to the instructions (my petit pois needed 3 minutes). Drain and plunge into the bowl with cold water to preserve the colour.",
						"2. Heat\u00a0up the olive oil in a large pan. Gently fry leeks and garlic, until fragrant and soft.",
						"3. Place cooked petit pois/green peas, leek and garlic and all of the remaining filling ingredients apart from the breadcrumbs in a small food processor. Process until smooth, season to taste.",
						"4. If the mixture is too loose, add 1-2 tbsp breadcrumbs or ground almonds to thicken."

				{
					"GLUTEN-FREE PASTA DOUGH": [
						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine psyllium powder, sifted chickpea flour, tapioca and salt. Mix well.",
						"2. Add olive oil and water. Mix well with a spoon and then knead with your hands. You may need a touch more water especially if using cups instead of weighing your flours but only add more if the ingredients are too dry to come together to form a dough, it will initially feel like that might be the case but please persevere for a few minutes before adding more water. If your dough does need more water, add it very gradually, teaspoon by teaspoon. Finished dough should feel like play-dough, it should not be sticky. Rest it for 30 minutes.",
						"3. Divide the dough into two. Roll the dough out as thinly (2 mm ideally) as you can on a surface lightly dusted with rice flour. Roll the dough out into a long rectangle that is as wide as two ravioli placed side by side (in my case 10 cm  / 4 inches).",
						"4. Using a cookie cutter (I used a 5 cm / 2\u2033 one), gently mark out a single row of ravioli (see process photos). Place half a teaspoon of filling in the middle of each ravioli, using a damp finger paint around the perimeter of the circle, the fold the dough in half so that you have two layers of pasta one on top of the other. Alternatively, you could also cut both sides of your ravioli out and assemble them into your hands (see process shots)",
						"5. Using your fingers, press the two layers of pasta around each filling together, ensuring that you don\u2019t trap any air bubbles while doing that as it will make your ravioli burst during cooking.",
						"6. Once you fused the two layers of dough together, use a cookie cutter to the ravioli out. Run your fingers around each raviolo again to ensure it\u2019s sealed well. Keep sealed ravioli under a damp kitchen towel to keep them moist and supple.",
						"7. Once you\u2019ve made about 12, boil a small pot of water. Lower the heat to low-medium and add 6 ravioli to the simmering water at a time. Cook for about 3 minutes (or longer depending on the thickness of your dough). Fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on drying rack or a place."

Allow the mixture to bubble gently, whisking the whole time, for a few minutes so that there is no raw flour taste in your b\u00e9chamel, but make sure it doesn\u2019t colour.",

Initially the mixture may thicken really quickly and look a bit lumpy \u2013 don\u2019t worry, it will recover once all the milk has been whisked in. Continue adding in the rest of your milk, including the batch you\u2019ve whizzed up with garlic, miso and nutritional yeast.

Allow the dish to set for at least an hour or else the slices will come out messy, although I do recommend waiting to consume until the following day \u2013 the flavours will mellow and the dish will taste even better. Store the leftovers for up to 5 days in the fridge or freeze in airtight containers."

This one is a definite keeper! Thank you!",

Couldn't wait to get groceries to try it out, so made a few substitutions - used za'atar seasoning in the tofu marinade instead of Italian herbs, used mint in the cream instead of basil, and used a small zucchini and a few brussel sprouts instead of asparagus. This will be in the rotation for sure, hooked on the cream especially! Will be using the leftovers on pasta for lunch, I think!"

Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes/or thinner bits with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin.",

						"4. This bit is tedious, but necessary! Start adding sugar in 1 tbsp increments whipping well (going around the bowl if you have a handheld whisk) and slowly counting to 20 after each addition. I know, but trust me!",

Make sure the meringue touches the crust so that a seal is created. Be careful not to leave any airpockets under the meringue as these will be hollow after baking. Once you cover the entire pie with meringue, make decorative swirls with the back of your spoon.",
						"2. Place the pie in the pre-heated oven and bake for 25 minutes. By the time you are done, the meringue should get a crispy, pale golden crust. You can use a chef\u2019s torch to make it look more dramatic if you wish.",
						"3. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack. Allow it to cool COMPLETELY. Placing an icepack wrapped up in a kitchen towel under the wire rack (keep the pie in the tin) will speed things up a little.",
						"4. Meringue pies are best eaten on the day, but this one kept well for another day, sealed away in an air-tight container at room temperature (not in the fridge as it will make it weep). Keep away from any source of moisture, like steam raising from cooking pots, for example. Sugar in the meringue wicks moisture out of the air making meringue go soft."

				"The absolute BEST recipe!I have made this recipe a couple of times now, its time consuming but not particularly difficult as all the steps are explained really clearly. The pastry is crisp, the lemon curd is tart and tangy and the aquafaba meringue is fluffy on the outside with a crisp shell. I took it to a party and it was proclaimed by an omnivore to be the best LMP she'd ever eaten, so i think that is an absolute WIN!I am considering just making the lemon curd on its own (with a tad less cornflour so its a little softer) for spreading on cakes, its really delicious and would be lovely in a sponge (or on toast!)You will not regret making this, treat yourself!",
				"Soooo good! It takes a bit of effort but then that's totally expected. It went down so well with my guests - everyone asked for seconds. Thank you so much, it's a keeper! Becca",
				"I made this dessert for my dad's 70th birthday get together and OH MY, everyone loved it and half of them were not even vegan! They could not get over the fact how good it tasted and that I used no eggs or dairy - a proud vegan moment. I really appreciate your detailed instructions and attention to detail, the recipe came together so smoothly and I cannot wait to make it again. Thanks Ania!",
				"Im currently making this now, and will do the meringue tomorrow... Im following recipe as is this time.... and Ive given it 5 stars, cos your recipes are always a winner! Buttt, I would love to know your thoughts on adapting it to make it refined sugar free... I have tried adding ground coconut sugar to whipped aquafaba already, but it deflates so much... though I did use it for your ladyfingers, for the tiramisu, and it didn't effect the end result of the biscuits... but I think for this, it would be a no go to sub the castor sugar for the meringue bit, but what about for the lemon filling? Any ideas? Anyway, excited to see how this turns out,  you were reading my mind by working on lemon meringue! Thank you, as always for your hard work that goes into all these delicious recipe creations! X",

It's not very common to eat or bake scones in Germany but I wanted to do something other that the usual wild garlic pesto. I used white spelt flour and and some pumpkin seed flour (25% of the amount of flour) and the nutiness added a nice flavour and layer. Thank you, Ania, for the recipie and for broading (my) horizon. This applies to the wild garlic ravioli as well :)",

It was quite sticky to roll into balls with my hands.. but the batter is so yummy, so I could easily clean my hands!! \ud83d\ude0bI missed the step of baking one tray at a time,  so baked both trays at the same time.

If using BANANA, mash it really well and combine with the next 5 ingredients and the same amount of water. If using maple syrup, be sure to start off with half of the amount of water and add more if needed.",
						"2. Transfer the mixture to a medium sized mixing bowl and sift in flour, baking powder, baking soda and kala namak (if using). Using a spatula, make small circles in the middle of the batter to gradually fold in more and more flour in order to minimise lumps. Cover with a plate and set aside for 15 minutes in the fridge. Make the filling while you wait.",
						"3. After chilling time, the batter is likely to need a little more water (I added 15 ml / 1 tbsp) to make sure it\u2019s runny enough to form perfectly round pancakes.",
						"4. Heat up a medium non-stick frying pan on the stove, but be careful not to get the pan too hot as the pancakes will burn before cooking in the middle. You want to use low-medium heat.",
						"5. Grease the pan with a bit of oil \u2013 I used a square of folded paper towel dipped in oil. Wipe off any excess oil \u2013 oil droplets will stop you from achieving perfectly uniform golden undersides \u2013 dorayaki\u2019s signature look.",

Leave undisturbed for about 3 minutes (until tiny bubbles appear on the surface and burst) on one side and then flip. Cook for 1 minute on the other side. Place on a drying rack to cool. As the pan gets hotter, the pancakes will cook quicker so keep an eye on the heat and lower if necessary.",

				"2. Cut butternut squash into a 1.25 cm / \u00bd\u201d dice and coat in 15 ml / 1 tbsp of olive oil. Season lightly and spread on the baking tray. Cut the top of the garlic head off to expose the cloves, drizzle with \u00bd tsp of olive oil and wrap it up completely in two layers of greaseproof baking paper or in a piece of kitchen foil and place on the tray, next to the pumpkin. Put into the hot oven.",
				"3. Give the pumpkin a good stir after 20 minutes and check on the garlic \u2013 it is done when the cloves are soft all the way through. Remove the garlic from the oven if done. Carry on roasting the pumpkin until soft and lightly charred \u2013 another 10 minutes.",
				"4. Heat up 2 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy bottomed pan or pot, one that you have a fitted lid for. Add sage leaves and allow them to crisp up in the hot oil for 30-45 seconds. Once done \u2013 they will become darker in colour and stiff \u2013 fish them out of the oil and place on a piece of kitchen paper, set aside.",
				"5. Add diced onion to the sage flavoured oil. Fry on a low heat until translucent, stirring from time to time. Season, keeping in mind that both miso and your stock (if salted) will contribute some saltiness too, so go easy.",
				"6. Warm up veggie stock in a separate pot. Take a splash of warm stock and pour it into a separate bowl with miso paste and nutritional yeast. Mix the three together until you get a smooth, lump-free mixture and then add it back to the main pot. Stir well. Keep this stock hot.",
				"7. Once onion is translucent, add chopped garlic cloves and season again lightly. Fry, stirring frequently, until fragrant and softened (about 2 minutes).",
				"8. Mix in arborio rice and fry it off for a few seconds, stirring frequently.",
				"9. Next add wine and give the rice a good stir so that it doesn\u2019t stick to the pan. Allow the wine to cook off completely before adding the first small portion (60 ml / \u00bc cup or so) of the hot stock.",
				"10. Keep on adding the stock, in small amounts, until fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next portion. Make sure to stir the rice often to activate the starch, which makes for a creamy risotto.",
				"11. Once pumpkin is out of the oven, transfer 1 cup (about 150 g) of roasted pumpkin, squeezed out garlic cloves and 1 cup of water to a blender. Blend until smooth. Then add it the rest of the stock and warm the whole thing up, before adding into the the risotto bit by bit, like you did with the stock up to this point.",
				"12. Keep on adding the liquid (you may not need all of it) to the rice until the rice is almost cooked. Decrease the amounts of liquid towards the end as you want the rice cooked correctly \u2013 soft but with a little of a bite (al dente) as well as the correct consistency \u2013 if you run a wooden spoon through the middle of the risotto, rice should fill the space behind your spoon very slowly.",
				"13. Once the rice is al dente, stir in some vegan cream if using, fine tune the seasoning and add a bit of balsamic vinegar if you like a touch of acidity to break through the creaminess. Switch the heat off, cover the pan and allow the risotto to rest for 3-5 minutes.",
				"14. Divide the risotto between bowls, top with roasted butternut squash, crumbled sage leaves and optionally almond bacon."

Rather than a mild olive oil I used a stronger one as I live in Spain and have access to truly amazing oil. I cannot explain how amazing this recipe is, the right amount of zestiness, saltiness and with little oil. I\u00b4d give it 6 stars if I could!",

I used 4 black bananas (they were on the brink of spoiling), a couple tablespoons of leftover icing from Christmas that was still in the fridge somehow and some almond butter that has completely separated into almond oil and rock hard almond solids. It came out really well!One thing I am wondering about is whether 1 c flour really is 125 g? It seemed very little when I was adding it to the rest of the batter so I added a bit more. I was making the batter in a Thermomix and weighting everything is easier for me.",

				"1. If using porcini, soak them in 480 ml / 2 cups of boiling water as much in advance as you can. You can use a mushroom stock cube dissolved in boiling water instead.",
				"2. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (or 20\u00b0 C / 70\u00b0 F less with a fan) and grab a large baking tray.",
				"3. Cut any wooden, tough bits off the mushroom stems. Using your hands, tear the mushrooms into strips starting from the cap. Chop mushroom strips into a dice.",
				"4. In a mixing bowl, combine 15 ml / 1 tbsp olive oil, 15 ml / 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp tomato puree and nutritional yeast (a sprinkle of garlic powder is also nice). Mix well and coat chopped mushrooms in this mixture. You can leave the mushrooms to marinate for a few hours, but you can also just bake them straight away \u2013 it makes little difference to the overall ragu flavour.",
				"5. Spread mushrooms on a baking tray and bake for about 10 minutes, give them a good stir and bake for a further 10-15 minutes.",
				"6. While the mushrooms are baking, heat 30 ml / 2 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add diced onion and saut\u00e9 on a low heat for a few minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.",
				"7. Add the chopped garlic and saut\u00e9 for a about 2-3 minutes (until it softens and becomes fragrant), stirring frequently.",
				"8. Season (bearing in mind that soy sauce contributes saltiness too), add the remaining teaspoon of smoked paprika, cumin, chilli and chopped herbs. Stir well to coat.",
				"9. Next, add in carrots and celery dice. Saut\u00e9 for a few minutes before adding wine. Allow the wine to cook off before adding tomato passata.",
				"10. Rinse rehydrated porcini under the tap to ensure there is no grit in them, dice very finely and add to the pan togeter with mushroom stock taking care not to tip in the grit that settles at the bottom.",
				"11. Add tomato passata, the rest of the tomato paste, 15 ml / 1 tbsp soy sauce and bay leaves. Reduce the sauce (lid off) on a low heat for about 20 minutes. Give it a stir from time to time.",
				"12. Stir in chopped walnuts and baked oyster mushrooms. Taste, adjust the seasoning if needed. For best flavour, store the sauce in the fridge overnight for the flavours to meld.",
				"13. When serving with pasta, reserve about 240 ml / 1 cup of pasta cooking water (you may not need all of it) to loosen the sauce a little and make it coat your pasta strands better."

				"This ragu is so good! I love it to not use the substitute meat from the supermarket. Oyster mushrooms are the best. The ragu is full of flavor and very rich. My stepchildren liked it a lot (they think vegan food is stupid).Be careful with the fresh rosemary \ud83d\ude05",
				"Absolutely delicious! The texture was amazing and so full of flavour. A big hit in our house, will definitely be making again \u2764\ufe0f",
				"Absolutely delicious recipe, will definitely make this a regular weeknight meal and great for batch cooking and freezing! Also made the vegan parmesan, which is miles better than any shop bought vegan parmesan I've tried.",
				"Hi, after a heart event last year, I have been trying to live a healthier life which has also included eating vegan food. It has been a challenge getting my husband to make a shift away from meat and sometimes we still have separate meals. This meal, however, is an absolute winner with him so THANK YOU for adding another staple to our menu options! Tille.",
				"This is an amazing recipe. It wasn\u2019t quick, it took me a while to make it. But is was so worth the effort. And even our picky 5 yr old loved it. I reduces the smoked paprika a bit, but that is very personal, I think. For me the smoke taste becomes too strong very quick.",
				"Fantastic recipe! I didn\u2019t have the porcini so I used a little white miso+water for umami & so skipped the soy sauce on the step adding the broth & sauce (still used the soy to season the shrooms before baking) Next time, if not using the porcini mushrooms, I\u2019\u2019ll definitely up the amount of oyster- or maybe add some cremini or shiitake- just so the finished product is super full of mushroom-y goodness. Will definitely make again- thank you!",
				"Made this the other night. Used crumbled tofu instead of oyster mushrooms, needed baking for probably twice as long but the end result was delightful. Thanks for the delicious recipe",
				"I made this last night and it was delicious. I had to sub porcini mushrooms  with mushroom stock and oyster mushrooms with regular. Had the leftovers for lunch today and it was even tastier! Definitely will be making this available",
				"just made this and wow a really comforting meal with lots of umami. thank you for another amazing recipe \ud83e\udd17",
				"Hi recipe quantities are for 6 or 7  people. Can I freeze any excess ragu. Always useful to have as a go to in the freezerThanks - looking forward to trying it",
				"Hi, When you chop the porcini mushrooms do they need cooking before going into the sauce, cant wait to try this recipe xThanks",
				"I hope that everything goes well at the vet. recheck.  I\u2019m wishing your four legged family member a complete healing and that she/he will be back to a healthy normal very soon.I know how worrisome a sick/recovering fur baby can be for us. I\u2019ve been there done that at least twice (once with an 8 week old kitten and once with a 13 year old cat\u2026\u2026kitten survived, cat did not) within the last three years.Your vegan ragu with pasta sounds delicious and comforting.

				"Perfect recipe! I was worried the pancakes would be hard to flip and that I'd make a big mess of them but they work SO well and are so easy to do. (I use a cast iron crepe pan with a very flat surface and low sides). I've been making this recipe almost weekly since I tried it. When I'm entertaining or just want an easier dinner-prep, I make the pancakes earlier in the day and they hold up well. I add both onion and spinach to the potatoes for flavor and a healthy dose of greens.",
				"Just made this, it was fab! I threw some leftover flax egg I had in the fridge into the batter which didn't seem to do any harm (cut back a bit on water and chickpea flour to compensate), and used some coconut cream with lime instead of yogurt for topping, and our best home made tomato chutney. From these quantities I got six pancakes in a 20 cm pan, they were quite thick and substantial, I think I could have gone got more if I'd gone a bit thinner with the batter but I was nervous they'd break up. I'd quite like to make small ones in the little blini pan next time but they do take a long time to cook compared to normal pancakes. Anyway, they were delicious, and the masala potatoes were too, and very easy. Spinach in with those sounds a good idea. I didn't put anything into the pancake mix except salt and a little black pepper, and it was just as well, as my husband was eyeing up second helpings and asked if he could have a small one for dessert. We had them with local Brittany buckwheat honey - which we have no objection to eating as we're not strict vegans, but I'm sure maple syrup or other vegan options would be great too - and the rest of the coconut lime cream and they were just as good sweet as savoury!I've not been following your blog very long and find it a great discovery and very inspiring, thank you!",
				"This was delicious! The cashew cream went really well with it and with chutney & cilantro it was so good! I had to stop myself from eating way too much. Awesome recipe! Thank you!  it took more than half an hour to cook all the pancakes, one by one, though. I think I got at least 10 of the 1/4 cup pancakes!",
				"So yummy!    I\u2019m glad I took the time to precook and cool the potatoes; the crispy bits were just extra deliciousness. Added spinach with garbanzo beans on the side with the same spices but it would have been a complete meal without it. The pancakes were easy and delicious!",
				"This is an incredible and super tasty meal! The lentil pancakes are flavorful and easy to make. Delicious with the potatoes and all the fixings. A must try! Wholesome, filling and flavorful meal. You will be transformed. Such a tasty recipe! Thank you, Ania!",
				"This is a wonderfully satisfying and delicious dish. The pancakes have an incredible flavour and I can see them becoming a staple in our household. What I also like is that it is such a cheap and filling meal yet really nourishing esp if you can toss in a bit of spinach to wilt with the potatoes. A great hit! Totally love Your recipes. Thank you."

I open the potato just a little so that the steam doesn\u2019t get trapped inside.",

Once all the tomatoes have broken down nicely (see photo) and the sauce is thick and uniform, season with maple syrup, molasses, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, vegan Worcester sauce and blitzed ancho chilli (if using). You will probably need to add quite a bit more salt too \u2013 go by your palate.  Finally, add cooked beans and allow the entire pot to simmer for 10 more minutes or so."

						"1. Soak porcini mushrooms in 400 ml / scant 1\u00be cups of boiling water to soften them and to obtain a mushroom infused stock. I recommend 8 hours at least, 24 hours is even better. If making your own tomato sauce, get it going first (recipe below) and then return to the rolls while it simmers.",
						"2. Chop fresh mushrooms into a small dice. If using a food processor, slice thickly first and use the pulse method. Pulse mushrooms in smaller batches and be very careful not to overprocess, you want coarse dice, not mush.",
						"3. Heat up oil in a large pan you have a lid for. Add diced shallots, fry them off on a low-medium heat until soft and translucent (about 10 minutes). Next add in garlic \u2013 fry for a few minutes stirring frequently as it burns easily.",
						"4. Stir in smoked paprika, a good pinch of salt and pepper and thyme leaves. Stir all the ingredients around for a few seconds on low heat, next add half of the chopped mushrooms. If the water released from the mushrooms does not deglaze the pan, add a splash of wine.",
						"5. Once the first portion of the mushrooms cooks down a little, add the second. Allow it to cook down completely, before adding the rest of the wine, finely chopped porcini (make sure you rinse the grit off first and keep the stock), walnuts, balsamic and soy sauce. Carry on cooking the mushroom mixture until all the excess liquid evaporates. Taste and adjust the seasoning being mindful that rice will dilute the intensity.",
						"6. Next, add in rinsed rice and all of the mushroom stock without the grit that tends to settle at the bottom. Cover the pot and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, once it starts to simmer count about 10 minutes, then switch off the heat and keep the lid on the pan for a further 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.",
						"7. Remove the leaves of the cabbage by making a delicate incision at the bottom of each leaf (where it attaches to the head), prising the leaf off gently. You will need about 14 whole leaves in total. I used large and medium leaves from 2 cabbage heads and kept the rest for a stir-fry or soup.",
						"8. Bring a big pot of water to the boil and grab a large bowl, fill it with cold water (ice cubes help but are not necessary).",
						"9. Plunge 4-5 leaves at a time into the boiling water. Blanch them, submerged fully (a smaller lid is often used to weigh them down), for 3-4 minutes. Fish them out and plunge them into the cold water.",
						"10. Thin the outside stem of each leaf with a sharp knife (see photos). Run the knife along the stem trimming off any excess that jets out above the leaf\u2019s surface.",

						"12. Pour 480 ml / 2 cups of tomato sauce and 240 ml / 1 cup of water to the bottom of the dish. Mix the two together.",
						"13. Place a trimmed cabbage leaf on the work bench so that the inside faces you. Place a tablespoon or two (depending on the size of the leaf) of the filling at the bottom of each leaf, fold the sides to the middle and then roll the leaf gently until the filling is safely enclosed inside. Place it snugly in the prepared baking dish, with the seam down. Continue with the remaining leaves in the same manner.",
						"14. Cover the pot with a lid and bake for about 20 minutes.",
						"15. Remove the lid and bake for a further 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the cabbage leaves are fully cooked through (a sharp knife should slide right through the thickest part of the leaf). If you want the cabbage leaves charred, switch the oven to the grill function for the last 10 minutes (or so) and brush the leaves lightly with olive oil \u2013 watch carefully as they can burn quickly."

				"The mushroom filling for this is delicious and is nice by itself, kind of like a risotto. Turning it into the rolls with the cabbage makes it look more impressive though and wasn't nearly as fiddly as I thought it'd be. I added the walnuts as suggested and they gave it that little extra crunch. I used red wine instead of white and only had basmati rice but both worked out fine.",
				"Well, the filling is delicious. I'm not sure how tender the cabbage leaves are supposed to be once they're fully cooked in the oven, or whether the rolls are supposed to hold together in one piece when you cut them--I found them just a little troublesome to cut cleanly with a knife. Very very tasty, though! I used brown rice for the filling (cooked before adding to the filling) and it worked really well.",
				"Got a present of Wild Ballyhoura Mountain (Ireland) dried mushrooms and used them in this recipe - really pleased with results thank you!",
				"Your cabbage rolls look so pretty! Sound delicious too! In my opinion a plate of neatly rolled cabbage rolls in tomato sauce does not look any worse than some pasta dish and far more appealing than lasagna :)! I have never tried making them with savoy cabbage - have to give it a go! Cabbage rolls are in heavy rotation in our family. My Ukrainian granny made them naturally plant-based with potatoes and buckwheat, shredded potatoes, rice, buckwheat and veggies and so on. She usually used porridge rice and the rolls held their shape well and were very juicy. So, really, people - give it a try, you are in for a treat! Thank you Ania!",
				"These look epic! I will definitely making them very soon :)",
				"We were, happily, given a galabki recipe by a Polish neighbour when I was a child.  It was made with ground meat.  I often wished I could replicate it, as I am vegan, but couldn't find a recipe that was baked.  Thanks for this; can't wait to try it.",
				"I'm gonna make this, but could i use huge CHARD leaves in stead of cabbage?",
				"My mom makes go\u0142\u0105bki as her mother did--with hamburger (no rice)--and as a child (even before I became a vegetarian), I just ate the mashed potatoes she served with it. Now you've given me a go\u0142\u0105bki I can actually eat and ENJOY! Thank you!"

If you don\u2019t have a tin the right size, do not worry, use a large baking tray \u2013 this pie is pretty self-contained.",
						"2. To assemble the pie, clear a large area of your work bench to make room for a long row of pastry sheets joined together. Keep the pastry sheets you are not working with under a damp kitchen towel so that they do not dry out and become brittle.",

						"5. Brush the entire area with a little bit of oil again before arranging the filling on top. I placed a row of pumpkin, followed by cheese and dollops of balsamic onions here and there for pops of flavour.",
						"6. Put a long snake of filling along the longer edge of the pastry leaving a 5 cm / 2\u2033 margin at the bottom. Try to make the filling amount the same everywhere. I ended up using 6 double sheets so I used half of the filling on the first 3 double sheets and the remainder for the remaining 3 double sheets.",
						"7. Starting from the bottom, gently roll the pastry into a long, slightly loose snake. Gently coil the snake and place in the greased baking tin, seam down.",

						"11. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, until golden brown. Allow the pie to \u2018set\u2019 after baking before cutting into it. This pie is best eaten fresh but if you want to reheat it, it is best to reheat individual coils at 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F for 10 minutes or so."

Make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.

When the water barely starts to simmer, switch the heat off but keep the bowl on the pot.",
						"3. Once the chocolate looks melted, very gently and slowly stir it into the other ingredient(s). Stir as little as you can (dark chocolate in particular is very sensitive to overstirring).",

						"6. If using SUGAR (instead of maple syrup), whisk it into the whipped aquafaba at this point, tablespoon by tablespoon, whipping well after each addition so that the sugar melts into the meringue mixture.",
						"7. Wipe the bottom of the bowl with ganache so that water droplets don\u2019t end up in your aquafaba and ensure chocolate ganache is just barely warm. Add approximately a third of it to the bowl of aquafaba. Using a slow folding motion, incorporate the ganache into the aquafaba gently. Incorporate the other two thirds in the same manner, being very gentle and slow so that you don\u2019t knock too much air out of the aquafaba. The mixture will deflate a fair bit before you are done \u2013 that\u2019s normal \u2013 but it should still be very mousse-y and airy (full of tiny bubbles) when you are done.",

				"I'm lucky enough to be able to buy a hazelnut vegan non palm oil spread, but it's so expensive I agree that starting from scratch is better! I might half cheat and buy pre-made hazelnut butter though, because my food processor isn't that good and will probs blow up if i try and make nut butter with it. Thank you for all the helpful info on chocolate seizing and aquafaba needing to be pristine. These are things I've only found out accidentally and so much more useful if the recipe maker points to these things in advance. hope your festive thing goes well! xx"

				"1. If making gluten-free version, hydrate psyllium husks in 2 tbsp water, set aside to jellify.",

				"3. Place 40 g / \u00bc cup icing sugar, flour, almond flour (or ground almonds), salt and cardamom (if using) in a food processor together with cubed fat. Pulse a few times, until the fat gets evenly distributed and the mixture sticks together when you pinch it. Alternatively, you could make the dough by hand, using a pastry cutter (or two knifes) first and then your fingers.",
				"4. Next, add in vanilla extract or paste, almond essence and (if making these gluten-free) rehydrated psyllium husks and pulse again. If using powdered vanilla, you may need to add a teaspoon of water if the dough is still too dry to come together. Transfer to a bowl and shape the dough into a disc. Wrap in clingfilm or baking paper and refrigerate for at least 60 minutes (or longer). I found that the gluten-free version needs a bit longer in the fridge (4 hrs or longer).",
				"5. While the dough is resting, mix icing sugar with vanilla powder or vanilla seeds (from a pod) to dust the cookies with as soon as they leave the oven. If you only have the liquid form of the vanilla, skip and simply use icing sugar on its own. Prepare a baking tray.",

				"8. Arrange the crescents on a paper-lined baking tray and bake until lightly golden, about 10-12 minutes.",

				"Hi Ania, I have made quite a few different vanilla crescents recipes (almost always good tasting) but these were really perfect in every way: the dough came together easily (not too sticky nor too dry) and they taste so very, very delicious! I was generous with the cardamom because I love it when cookies have some spice in it besides the vanilla, but I left out the almond extract (I did not have any). I made the version with gluten and vegan butter. I will never get tired of making and eating these  : )  Thank you very much for another delicious recipe!",
				"Extreeemely delicious! Got eaten up within a couple of hours and there's only two of us (oops... \ud83d\ude05 ) Thank you for this lovely recipe!",

However my grandma makes them every year (I am from the Czech Republic) and since I can't go and have them there, I am so happy I found this recipe. They are very easy to make - the recipe is well written and they are just so delicious.",
				"These look delicious! Do you think I'd have much success freezing the dough, a week in advance of baking and defrosting? Thanks in advance!",
				"Great recipe, easy to follow,  the shortbread biscuits are delicious.",
				"I find it really hard to get nice vegan cheese. Most of them are foul (sorry if that's strong but it's how I feel). Do you buy them or are there delicatessens that do decent ones?",
				"I love it when you post Polish-inspired recipes!! My grandmother & great-grandmother were very polish and I remember treats like these when I was very very young.I know it's not traditional, but could you shape these differently and still have them turn out ok? I'm thinking traditional round cookie shape. Or would they be too dense then?"

Whip the aquafaba with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form \u2013 you need to be able to invert the bowl over your head and the mixture should not move at all.

				"I made the fast and easy version of these and they are now my new favorite cookie. SO GOOD.",
				"I just tried these (whipped aquafaba method), and they completely collapsed in the oven into a flat mess. Any idea where we went wrong? They taste good though. The only difference from the recipe  is that the pistachios were nubbly and not entirely finely ground - we only had whole ones and don't have a coffee grinder so just bashed them up as much as we could. Don't know if that would have made them collapse, or if we maybe over-mixed the dough after putting in the aquafaba? Thanks!",

This looks amazing, but I have a question - it\u2019s my understanding that in ordering to get the benefits of miso\u2019s probiotic enzyme nutrients (for gut micro biome health) it should not be heated beyond 115F, as anything higher kills those probiotics.  Of course if it\u2019s just added to enhance flavour and not for the nutrient benefit, that\u2019s a different story! I\u2019m a nutrition nut from Victoria, BC Canada, 77 yrs old, vegan for 4 1/2 yrs, and LOVING it!  Feel SO blessed to be in this age when any recipe in the world is at my fingertips!

				"Wow, what a tiramisu, amazing!Made it for Christmas. I used chai latte instead of coffee (really can\u2019t stand the taste of coffee). That was a really good recommendation of you, Ania!And the lady fingers.. oh my.. so good. The exact same as the ones from the store.",
				"Lovely recipe, so easy to make (I didn't bother piping the biscuits, used a spoon instead - they came out a little messy but still delish) and the result is sublime. My dinner party guests raved about it!",
				"Ania, thank you so much for this AMAZING recipe! I made the whole thing including your sponge fingers and the result surpassed my expectations. It took some time but then that's to be expected with a dessert like this. The flavor and texture were beautiful and even my non-vegan guests were mightily impressed. Thank you!!! Amanda",
				"This dessert was perfection, Ania! I could not believe how good it was and my vegetarian husband went back to seconds. It took a while to make but that's to be expected given having to make vegan sponge fingers from scratch - they were great btw, I will leave another review too. Thank you for all your amazing recipes, we love you blog and they really make a big difference to our lives. Helen",
				"Loved this recipe, delicious and not hard to make, thank you!",
				"OMG! Cooked this for my wife on Valentine's Day and it was the star of the show. Easy to make and delicious!!",
				"Ania, this dessert was perfection! Both the tiramisu itself and the sponge biscuits. A lot of work, but so worth it, everyone was oooohhhing and aaaahhhhing. Thank you for all your hard work, your recipes never fail to impress my guests. Sara",
				"Yay yipee yay! I made half the cream mixture recipe and full ladyfinger recipe (but only used half of the actual ladyfingers)  to make 5 mini tiramisu pots! What a (another!!) winner of a recipe Ania! Yes i agree that the ladyfingers could be soaked more than briefly, so I just soaked them a bit longer but took them out before they could crumble or disintergrate!I used the softened dates instead of icing sugar, and although it changes the colour of the \"cream\", it is still absolutely delicious! I also used coconut sugar in the ladyfingers instead of caster sugar, and they turned out great -I ground the sugar first to make it finer... Thank you once again for an epic recipe! Aim\u00e9e",
				"Okay, SO. This is my second time making a vegan tiramisu recipe--the first time (with a different recipe), I was really unsatisfied with. For the sake of others learning from my experience should they encounter similar difficulties, I'll be somewhat detailed here.First, the ladyfingers! I don't know if I added too much flour (I measured by volume and not weight, rookie mistake), but the dough came out very dry--I added a little bit of almond milk, but it was still more like a sugar cookie dough than anything you could pipe, and I was wary of overmixing by adding more and more liquid. So I ended up shaping the dough with my fingers into cylinders and pressing them down, which surprisingly seemed to work fine, and they came out pretty much perfect. The mascarpone was really tasty, and the filtered coconut oil worked great (I used Thrive Market's)--no coconut taste whatsoever. I wonder if, because the original is technically a cheese, it could use something to create a slight tang, like lemon juice. Overall though I'm pretty happy with it!According to my Italian mother, the ladyfingers are supposed to get rather soggy in the coffee mixture. I think the taste of coffee in the final product could have been stronger, myself. The cookies were certainly crisp enough to withstand longer soaking, but I wanted to follow instructions and only briefly submerged them. Do with this information what you will!Very excited to have had success with this recipe. Thank you!!",
				"Hi! So I tried making the ladyfingers again yesterday (my mom actually requested that I do!), and made sure to measure everything by weight. I still seemed to have ended up with a very stiff dough--I wonder if my aquafaba sitting in the fridge for a week or two beforehand could have contributed to it? For the sake of transparency, I want to note that I used tapioca starch instead of corn or potato, and instead of a tsp of lemon juice in the aquafaba, I used 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar. These seem like very small adjustments on the surface to me, so I'm unsure they should really affect the dough much, but I'm admittedly an amateur so who knows. Same as last time, I ended up shaping them with my fingers. They still turned out fine! Totally useable in another tiramisu recipe. Not sure what I'm doing incorrectly, though.",
				"Hi! I saw in a comment below that you said using vegan cream cheese is possible to replace the silken tofu (not that I'm worried about the tofu--just that I like the idea of using cream cheese!). How much would you recommend using in the recipe?Also! Most tiramisu recipes I find usually call for a layer of whipped cream as the final layer (as opposed to just layering with mascarpone). I'm curious, is there a reason you decided not to do this in your recipe? Do you think adding it could be a good idea?Thank you in advance for your help!",
				"Really tasty end result but it definitely took a lot longer than 30mins to make. A couple of things about the recipe were confusing. 350g silken tofu - is this the weight straight out of the packet or after it's drained? I also typically press tofu otherwise it's too watery, which is what I did here, meaning I added much more than 350g as the tofu lost about 20% of its weight after being pressed. The cream also wasn't terribly sweet and just tasted like cashews so I added more sugar (probably x2 the amount) and also some lemon juice. I found the part about agar agar confusing. I used agar agar powder but it would have been good as a first timer to include specific agar agar instructions in the recipe - ie it needs to be boiled in order to be activated and straight after boiling it add it to the cream mixture and blend. The agar agar packet said to put in the fridge so that's what I did at first. Also the hyperlink for refined coconut oil goes to a page for unrefined coconut oil which the recipe says results in too much of a coconut taste. I'm really glad my partner helped or I would have thrown the towel in. I was very relieved it turned out well and my friends loved it.",
				"Hi Ania. Thanks so much for your reply.My answers as follows1) I definitely used silken tofu. I went to an Asian supermarket to be sure I had the widest variety available to choose from. It was very fragile but definitely very watery. 2) I used your lady fingers recipe :) they were great.3) I used the Golden Trophy brand agar agar, made in Thailand, as that seemed to be the best rated brand.",
				"What a beauty this dessert was!! I made it for Christmas Day and everyone was ooing and ahhing over it. It was beautiful (I made your sponge fingers also) and I will certainly be tempted to make it outside of Christmas too. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe. Sophie",
				"Happy New Year Ania! I made this for new years eve and it was phenomenal. My partner is Italian so he is a keen judge of these things! I must add a piping bag to my kitchen equipment list though, trying to improvise with cling film was a fairly messy endeavour! Thanks for including the tip on the mixing bowl being spotlessly clean - I think last time I tried whipping aquafaba that got me - worked perfectly this time though!",
				"Truly georgeous. I made your lady finger bics for base, but mine were long blobs as cant be bothered to pipe a biscuit. I halved recipe but made full coffee/alcohol amount by mistake and ended u using 2/3 of it. Did the agar method for thickening.  I had also made some speculoos spice blend and then forgot what i intended to do with it so put half a teaspoon in cream.  Was amazing and will be a staple for special occasions. Thanks x",
				"Hi Ania! This recipe looks so yummy!! Planning to make it for New Years Eve this year. I have a question\u2026 Can the cream be made ahead, the day before or will it set too much to spread it? Talking about the version with agar agar. Thanks x",
				"Hi thereIs 5 teaspoons agar agar powder correct? I was wondering if it should be 5 grams?Thank you!",
				"I am allergic to tofu is there an alternative I could use for the creamy part?",
				"Can I use unrefined coconut oil? Love your receipes by the way.",
				"Hi! This looks amazing!I'm allergic to soy. Is there a way to replace it?",
				"The new version of the website looks great!",

				"These turned out amazingly! They made a delicious vegan tiramisu and the few left over went perfectly with my morning cup of coffee. I was a little nervous when folding the dry ingredients with the whipped aquafaba, as it seemed like there was too much dry and all the air was dissappearing but in the end it was fine \ud83e\udd17",
				"These were fantastic, great recipe - so easy to put together! I made the regular version but I have a Celiac friend coming over for dinner soon and I cannot wait to make your tiramisu for her, I bet she will love it too. Helen",
				"I tried the gluten free version and the result was just perfect! I used in a vegan & gluten free tiramisu. Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hi Ania, thank you very much for this recipe, the ladyfingers turned out really nice :)I also tried the gluten free version but the dough was way too dry - impossible to push through the piping bag. Probably my gluten free mix works a bit differently than the one you use, how would you solve this problem? Thank you!",
				"Hey Ania,They came out super nice. Crunchier than expected as the color was still very light, but perfect for tiramisu. I can't wait to eat the tiramisu tomorrow! Definitely a very good recipe, five stars from me!I have one question though. Regular ladyfingers with eggs would require way more aquafaba (probably almost double) for the amount of flour/cornstarch you use. I assume you tried this and it didn't work out? Because the texture is very different from non-vegan ladyfingers, just was curious.",
				"Who doesn\u2019t love a Tiramisu. The recipe I have used in the past states to bake a cake then cut it and dry it out, like biscotti, so when I saw this recipe I was very excited. The ingredients are things you would normally have in your cupboard, so I didn\u2019t even have to venture out and pluck the red flower from the highest mountain top in Peru - although that would be an experience in itself! The recipe is very well written and comes together exactly as indicated. I needed help with the piping as I didn\u2019t have a big enough nozzle and the dough is very thick. My suggestion is to get a large nozzle. My husband ended up adapting a nozzle I never use to be bigger, and those biscuits came out very pretty. Oven temperature- this depends a bit more on your oven, if you are a baker and you know your oven then adjust to how you normally bake biscuits, my first batch I made exactly as written and they came out a bit overdone, so on the second batch I lowered the temp a bit and they were perfect. They don\u2019t take long to make either, the longest part is whipping the aquafaba (chickpea water) and the baking\u2026 These biscuits are delicious on their own too with tea, so if you don\u2019t want tiramisu then bake them because you can. I think they will work really well for a trifle too! What are you waiting for? Go on, you know you want to!",
				"Hi Ania,I made the biscuits a few weeks back and they came out beautifully. Then used them for your tiramisu recipe. Everything got wiped out clean in no time. Thank you so much for all the efforts you put in to make these perfect recipes. Love from India. \u2764\ufe0f",
				"Enjoy your recipes very much.  So, I was surprised that you did not have the PRINT feature for the lady fingers.  Was it just overlooked?",
				"If you can it would be lovely to have the ability to print from mobile devices. I personally use my phone and iPad exclusively in the kitchen. I suppose we can take screenshots of the recipes and print those off too.",
				"This is so exciting!  These Vegan Lady Fingers  are so perfect! They taste really good , have the ideal texture and can be used  to make Tiramisu.  We can't wait for your full vegan tiramisu recipe!",
				"Oooo Im so excited about what I think *may* be on the way, after this new recipe addition!!!! Yay!!! You are such a hardworker!!!  X",
				"Hi, I can't wait for the tiramisu filing recipe! I'm gf also. I would love to buy your book. I'm wondering how much of the book ihas gf options?? Thank you! \u2764",
				"I\u2019m so so excited to see this recipe! I\u2019ve scoured the Internet to find a recipe for actual vegan ladyfingers for tiramisu and have only seen cake and the like being used. Can\u2019t wait until the full tiramisu recipe comes out!"

If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 3 tbsp / 45 ml. Mix the water into the flour with a knife and then check with your hand that no more water is needed \u2013 the dough should clump together easily but should not feel wet. If it\u2019s too dry, add a tiny amount (one tsp at a time) more water, mix and check again.",

Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin.",

Allow them to blister on one side before flipping them to the other side and frying until browned and crisped up.",

Can you provide a bit more detail on using the psyllium husk powder properly?  Should I just mix it with the water with a utensil, or use an electric beater (beater is what I did the first time)?  How long should I let it thicken (clearly I went too long, but, having never worked with psyllium husk powder before, I had no idea it would turn into a gel after a certain amount of time)?  What should the consistency be like when it's at an \"optimal\" place?  Would mixing it into the flour with a utensil suffice, or should I use an electric beater?  How thoroughly should the dough be mixed?  Thank you so much!",
				"Wow these look lovely! Do you think this dough would also be good for something like a GF hand-rolled pasta?",
				"Can I freeze them and than cook?",
				"I really really loved these pierogi. I even prefer this dough to non gf dough. It seems lighter and has a bit of savoury bite to it. The filling was just perfect. I had a bit of filling left and used it as topping to a salad. Super tasty! Thank you! Will make again!",
				"Incredible easy gluten free dough and so delicious. Thank you for the inspiration and love your recipes!",
				"That's right! I forgot to mention in my previous entry that my grandma starts making porcini mushroom uszka in November for Wigilia because they are everyone's favourites (she usually makes over 500 of them - talking about pierogeddon, haha!) She would freeze them in batches and we would have leftovers for new year's and January :)",
				"I just came to say I lol'ed at \"pierogeddon\" \ud83d\ude06 your friend sounds like a blast to be around.I'm so glad you made it possibly for gluten free people to enjoy the ultimate Polish comfort food and it's great to know this recipe is here for when I want to entertain my gf friends :)",
				"Pierogi are delicious!  The filling has a rich taste \ud83c\udf31 As I made more dough, I served the second portion with red lentil and sun-dried tomatoes filling \ud83d\ude09 The dough has a universal flavor - it tastes delicious in a dry version, but it will also be delicious when sweet \ud83d\udc9a I recommend it \ud83e\udd5f",
				"If i want to pan fry them, do I have to cook them first for 5 minutes before placing them in the fridgerator?  Thanks so much.",
				"Thanks for this recipe, I look forward to trying it out! Kristal",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe- that's our Christmas Eve sorted, as it suits absolutely everyone's tastes and requirements, specially if they can be frozen ahead?  As I'm not experienced at home freezing, could you give some more specific instructions about how to freeze please, and  whether to de-frost or cook from frozen? I'm really excited to try these - I used to make kreplach, which look quite similar, (and would fry them after boiling, instead of putting them in soup) until 2 of the family became gluten intolerant."

						"1. Place both flours, salt and dried yeast in a large bowl. Mix well.",
						"2. Melt vegan butter (or coconut oil) over low heat and measure out 300 ml / 1 and \u00bc cups of lukewarm water.",
						"3. Pour the liquids into the flours and mix with a spoon to combine roughly. Be aware that if you make any changes to the types of flours (or their ratios) used, you may need to adjust the amount of liquid a little. Also, your brand of flour may be slightly more or less absorbent than mine so be prepared to add (or hold back) a touch more liquid.",
						"4. When the dough starts looking scraggly and mostly stuck together, turn it out on to a work surface. If it feels dry, add a touch more water. The dough should not be too sticky and quite easy to work with.",
						"5. Knead the dough by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out by sliding the heel of the other hand into it. Reform the dough, rotate it a few degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is elastic and smooth.",
						"6. Put the dough in a large clean bowl and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside in a warm place, for 20-30 minutes for skinner, less fluffy pretzels and until the dough doubles in size (which usually takes 1-1\u00bd hours ) for fluffier ones.",
						"7. While the dough is proofing, line two baking trays with baking paper.",
						"8. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 8 identical portions \u2013 approximately 100 g / 3\u00bd oz each.",
						"9. Roll each portion into a thin 60 cm / 24\u2033 snake. A shorter snake will result in more of a knot-shaped bun.",
						"10. Form a U-shape with each snake, form a loop by placing one end on top of the other (see photos), then twist the bottom strand over the top one. Next fold the ends onto itself.",
						"11. Bring a medium-sized pot filled with 1 L / 4 cups of water and baking soda to a gentle simmer. Keep an eye on it as it has a tendency to boil over.",
						"12. Meanwhile, heat up the oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F.",
						"13. One by one, place each pretzel into the simmering soda water. Simmer it for 30 seconds on each side. Fish it out and place it on a drying rack. Carry on with the remaining pretzels.",
						"14. Sprinkle with sea salt and bake for about 12-15 minutes, depending how dark you like them (I bake mine for 15 minutes).",
						"15. They taste best on the day, but they are also nice toasted or baked very briefly (a few minutes only to crisp the skin again) the day after. Alternatively, freeze in an airtight container for about 1-2 months."

				"Your recipes seem good except the ads on your site nearly blew up my computers speakers and  gave me the fright of my life.

I used a walnut ricotta but am looking forward to seeing your almond ricotta recipe! Excited to try a new version of the ones weve been trying for years. Dinner was a complete success, ready for it to be lunch tomorrow so I can enjoy the leftovers.... maybe breakfast.... :p"

				"I\u2019ve had this recipe on my \u201cto make\u201d list since you first posted it. I finally made and, and wow. They are amazing. I had all the ingredients already in my house, so they were simple to make. Thanks for the recipe! What a great chocolatey way to bring in the New Year!",
				"Hey Ania, Mine have just come out the oven...smell divine! I baked them in two goes, so the first I just put a spoonful of the batter and left a lot of room around incase they spread - but though they look great -rustic - they havent acheived that round cookie shape like yours... So the second lot, I pressed them down to more of a round cookie shape... Which did you do? The second batch also looks cool but dont seem to have those beautif cracks like yours ..Can't wait to eat one just now! X",
				"Aimee: You might have a cooler oven like mine. I ended up baking them for closer to 15 and the cracks started forming. Thank you, Ania! My clients were asking for vegan cookies and these were a huge hit!- Rebecca",
				"Dear Ania,What amazing cookies. My granddaughter says they're the best she's ever tasted. Definitely for keeps!",
				"DELISH. What a fun treat. As a woman married to someone lactose intolerant it is always an adventure to find desserts that still taste like a dessert! This one nailed it. While I usually make the sweet potato cake by Lazy Cat Kitchen I thought I would try this new recipe. I am thinking we will need to have both from here on out. They were gone in 2.5 days. (ps.  i used egg whites and they turned out fab)",
				"These are so delicious! Love the texture and they're incredibly chocolatey. Will definitely be making them again - thanks for the recipe!",
				"I made this recipe today, it was easy to follow the instructions and the cookies came out of the oven smelling like heaven.  My daughter followed her nose into the kitchen and ate two before they had time to cool.  She loved them, the outside was crisp and the inside was fudgey like a brownie.  My husband and I had two each before they disappeared.  I will definitely be making them again, and again, and again.",
				"Hi, do you use the aquafaba as it is from tim or discard the liquid? Am tempted to try this recipe. Thanks a lot ya."

				"7. Once the stock is ready, fish out the mushrooms (you can slice them thinly and have in the soup or use in another dish) and corn cobs, pour the rest of it into a blender together with half of the corn kernels, soy milk, miso paste and a good pinch of salt and blitz until super smooth.",
				"8. Return the soup to the pot and warm it up gently. Season with vinegar and more salt (or soy sauce / tamari). Corn is sweet so I didn\u2019t feel the need to add any sweet seasoning but if you do, a touch of mirin will work well. If you wanted the ramen extra indulgent, you can whisk in a tablespoon of cashew or almond butter* in at the end.",
				"9. Divide between bowls, serve with cooked ramen noodles, steamed veggies, your favourite tofu and remaining charred corn kernels. Garnish the bowls with chilli (or toasted sesame) oil, spring onions / scallions and crushed sesame seeds."

				"Surprisingly easy and super tasty. I used tofu puffs instead of grilled tofu - I added them early on in the stock making process to really infuse them with flavour. Definitely making again!",
				"I have just made this for dinner and it\u2019s absolutely delicious!! I love the charred corn flavor! This is something new for me and my family and we all loved it! Even my four year old said it was \u201cyummy!\u201d Thanks for sharing this \u201cyummy\u201d recipe!",
				"SO good! I actually charred my broccolini in the same pan as my corn (cooked my marinated tofu in that pan, too), which added a lovely flavor element to the final dish, and I blitzed the mushrooms in with the broth rather than fish them out. The finished broth was wonderfully complex and had the perfect kiss of heat (I used one Serrano in with the aromatics). Delightful ramen!",

				"I used to get the most delicious vegan salted caramel chocolate in Australia. The brand was called loving earth. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t get anything like it here in Colombia. Your recipe tastes almost exactly the same, I\u2019ve made it probably 5 times now! Thank you so much Ania!!",
				"Hi Ania, Thanks for another super recipe!I was needing white chocolate for an Entremet experiment and could not find the appropriate vegan version locally. So I decided to try and make yours once I finally managed to find some unadulterated coconut milk powder (which was also a mission to find)!  Your recipe worked beautifully! I made my own cashew nut butter and as the coconut powder was ludicrously expensive, I decided to try and use all other additional required ingredients as wholesome as possible. So I made my own confectioners sugar from organic coconut blossom too. The end result was a beautiful salted caramel type chocolate that has held extremely well , even out of the fridge. I use a very strong sea salt, so over flavoured it with that a bit much but the chocolate was really good, if not quite the 'white' chocolate I had set out to do! I have not tried it in baking yet. Maybe I will make a batch of chocolate chip cookies and add some to that to see how it fairs. Fortunately I have now found a chocolatier who is making white chocolate for me for my entremet experiment, so I can just enjoy eating the one I made from your recipe on its own!",
				"It sounds delicious and would love to try it, dear! But here in Greece I cant find soy  milk powder. Could I omit it?Kisses from Zakynthos\u2665\ufe0f",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks so much for this white choc recipe! I have been wanting to make your white choc and raspberry cookies, and cant find vegan rsf white choc anywhere here!In regards to your anxiety, and away from computer time, I hear you. I have been distracting myself so much recently on my phone with mindless watching and scrolling and it is so self destructive to my state of mind.I suffer, in stages, with anxiety, and have found Himalaya's Geriforte tablets (a mix of natural Ayurvedic adaptogenic herbs-including Ashwaghanda) to really help - start for 1 week taking 2 tablets first thing on a morning and 2 tablets last thing at night... Thereafter, you can drop to 1 tablet am and pm... I really have found that they help me, and they work for your bodys needs (adapt-ogens)...I hope your anxiety gets better...its a horrible thing. Xx"

I found that the gluten-free version needed more water (about 160 ml / 2/3 cup) but please use your judgement as every flour has a slightly different absorbency level so the exact water amount may vary. It\u2019s better to start off with less water and add more if needed later. Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together \u2013 add a touch more water if the dough is too dry to gather all of the flour in the bowl, but do it carefully. If you are not using yoghurt, your dough will require extra water for sure.",

Can't wait to serve it to my guests and see what they think of it, as corn chowder is quite unknown in France. Thanks so much for the recipe :)",
				"Made this Chowder a couple of times now.  It absolutely deliciously creamy and very moreish.  It was also a hit with the family.  Thank you again",
				"It's offical this is the tastiest soup I've ever made! I used soya sauce instead of white miso as I couldn't get any & it is delicious! Already recommended it to my friends. Can't wait to make another batch Xxx",
				"Finally got around to making this on the weekend and used the M&S plant kitchen chorizo as suggested by you and they were so good.  This soup is absolutely delicious and will be made several times over the next few months as its gets colder.  Thanks for a great recipe.",
				"We had this for dinner and it was delicious!!Couldn't find vegan chorizo, so we opted for tofu instead, which we dredged through smoked paprika and cornflour and then fried until crispy! Worked well with the soup too! Now that autumn/winter is upon us ive been wondering: is there a vegan suet? My mum used to make a chicken soup with dumplings/knaedles and I'm dying for a wholesome vegan version!",
				"This recipe is incredible! Soo delicious",
				"Thank you for the tips re sweetcorn, it worked well and the soup was so delicious...! I'll definitely make it again and try to get corn cobs next time. Oh and if you have a Thermomix this soup comes together in minutes.Yes, I was so surprised - the texture and flavour of these sausages are spot on and very \"realistic.\" You can also get so many vegan things and a few ham options and cheese (which tastes like the cheapest Gouda immitation at a cheese monger - I haven't had it in years but my sister vouches for it) in Biedronka even in smaller towns. Oh and you can get kabanosy which are really good.Anyway, I hope you're enjoying the lake District - looking forward to trying other recipes xx",
				"This soup is delicious Ania. I had noticed lots of fresh corn in my local supermarket and then I saw your recipe on Instagram so I had to try it. Cooking the corn on the griddle first really did make a big difference to the flavour. I didn\u2019t manage to get vegan chorizo this time so I\u2019m going to have to make it again while there\u2019s still corn in abundance",
				"Hi Ania,This soup looks and sounds divine! And I really want to make it work with what I have at home.I don't have corn on the cobs unfortunately but I do have a bag of frozen sweet corn and I have sweetcorn 'broth' aka corn on the cobs cooking water with discarded cobs that I cooked in said water (i only had 2). Would I be able to grill the frozen sweetcorn and use that? What quantity do you reckon I'd need? Instead of chorizo I have some amazing vegan krakowska kie\u0142basa from when I visited my family in August... I was amazed at the vegan 'meat' options! I hope your trip to the Lake District goes well and the weather is nice!Basia xx",

			"title": "Vegan pretzel buns",
			"ingredients": [
				"250 g / 2 cups AP wheat flour, plus extra for dusting",
				"250 g / 2 cups bread / strong flour",
				"2 tsp fine salt",
				"8 g / 2 tsp instant dried yeast",
				"50 g / \u00bc cup vegan butter or odourless coconut oil or liquid oil",
				"35 g / slightly heaped 2 tbsp baking soda\nflaky salt, for topping",
				"flaky salt, for topping"
			],
			"time": "17 min",
			"serving": "makes 8-10",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Place both flours, salt and dried yeast in a large bowl. Mix well.",
				"2. Melt vegan butter (or coconut oil) over low heat. Combine it with 300 ml / 1 and \u00bc cups of lukewarm water.",
				"3. Pour the liquids into the flours and mix with a spoon to combine roughly. Be aware that if you make any changes to the types of flours (or their ratios) used, you may need to adjust the amount of liquid a little. Also, your brand of flour may be slightly more or less absorbent than mine so be prepared to add (or hold back) a touch more liquid.",
				"4. When the dough starts looking scraggly and mostly stuck together, turn it out on to a work surface. If it feels dry, add a touch more water. The dough should not be too sticky and quite easy to work with.",
				"5. Knead the dough by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out by sliding the heel of the other hand into it. Reform the dough, rotate it a few degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is elastic and smooth.",
				"6. Put the dough in a large clean bowl and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside, in a warm place for 1-1\u00bd hours, until the dough doubles in size. A very low (25\u00b0C / 77\u00b0F) oven works well too.",
				"7. While the dough is proofing, cut out eight or ten 10 cm / 4\u2033 squares of baking paper, one for each bun.",
				"8. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 8-10 identical portions \u2013 depending how big you want your roll. I made 10 and each roll was 84 g / 2.95 oz.",
				"9. Shape into a money sack. Place it, seam down, on a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a cupped head and roll it against the surface for about 30-60 seconds until you start feeling the bun\u2019s surface getting taut.",
				"10. Place each roll on a square of oiled (that\u2019s important) baking paper. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to proof until the dough balls double in size (second proofing) \u2013 about 20-30 minutes in a warm place.",
				"11. Just before the second proofing is finished, put a large pot (20 cm / 8\u2033 dia is ideal) filled with 1 L / 4 cups of water and baking soda to the boil. Allow the mixture to come to a gentle simmer but keep an eye on it as it has a tendency to boil over.",
				"12. Meanwhile, heat up the oven to 225\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F.",
				"13. One by one, lift each roll on its paper square off the tray. Flip the ball in your hand very gently so that the seam is at the top. Be very gentle as you don\u2019t want to knock any of the air out of the buns at this stage.",
				"14. Go around the perimeter of each ball and pinch the surface of the dough very gently between your thumb and index finger creating a seal in the middle of the bottom. This step helps the buns keep their shape during simmering.",
				"15. Place 2-3 (depending on the size of your pot) buns in the simmering baking soda solution. Allow them to simmer gently (low heat, small bubbles are preferable) for 60 seconds, then flip them gently to the other side using a large spoon. Simmer on the other side for a further 60 seconds. Fish them out and place them on a drying rack. Carry on with the remaining dough balls.",
				"16. Once the buns are completely dry, use a razor or a very sharp knife to make a shallow criss-cross incision at the top of each roll and sprinkle with salt (or sesame or poppy seeds).",
				"17. Bake for about 17-19 minutes, depending on the size of the buns. Consume on the day \u2013 they don\u2019t keep that well."

				"6. 15 minutes before you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F and line a large baking tray with a piece of greaseproof paper.",
				"7. Divide the batter into 12 equal size pieces, place them apart on the baking tray leaving a lot of space around each \u2013 you may need to bake them in two batches. Squash them down a little but don\u2019t worry too much as they will spread. Decorate the tops with leftover chocolate and almonds.",
				"8. Bake for about 12-13 minutes, until the edges get lightly browned.",
				"9. Allow the cookies to cool off for a bit before picking them off the baking tray \u2013 they are fragile whilst hot. They are best on the day they\u2019ve been baked as due to the presence of raspberries, they do tend to get a little soft the next day."

The first one I tried (not in these cookies, in another batch) just melted into oil and made a big mess of the cookies. Like, not a single chunk was left! I do find vegan white chocolate to be pretty hit or miss, and I'm not keen to have another oily mess instead of delicious cookies. Help?",

				"1. Cut your aubergines into 1 cm / 0.4\u2033 slices lengthwise. Heat up a griddle pan (you can also use a low heat area of your BBQ). Once the pan is hot, brush eggplant slices with a little bit of oil, season with salt and place them on the grill. Decrease the heat to low and allow the eggplants to grill slowly (about 10 minutes on each side initially \u2013 then a little less as the pan gets hotter) until cooked through and charred. Brush the other side with oil and grill the other side for 10 minutes. You will need to do them in batches. Alternatively, you could also cook them in the oven (without any oil if preferred), like in this recipe. As soon as the eggplant slices come off the pan, roll them up whilst they are still warm.",
				"2. OPTIONAL: While the eggplants are charring, toast the walnuts on a dry frying pan or in a 160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F until golden, about 10 minutes. You can skip this step but I find that it really enhances the flavour.",
				"3. OPTIONAL: Grate the garlic and place it in a small bowl with 1 tbsp of lemon juice \u2013 it will make the garlic taste more mellow without the need to cook it.",
				"4. Once the walnuts are cool, crush in a pestle and mortar or grind them in a food processor. I prefer the former as it allows me to control the texture better and I like to leave the filling a little chunky to contrast with the smooth eggplant flesh. If you prefer it to be smooth and creamy, use a food processor.",
				"5. Season the walnuts with lemon juice and garlic mixture, ground spices, date syrup and salt and pepper. Finally trickle a bit of hot water (I used 90 ml / 6 tbsp) to the walnuts while processing / crushing them by hand and a touch of walnut oil (you can use olive oil or skip) to make the filling less crumbly.",
				"6. Unfurl eggplant slices, place a heaped teaspoon of the mixture at the widest end of the slice and roll the eggplant up tightly (you can use wooden toothpicks to hold them in place).",

				"Stunning recipe!! I made it again and skipped some ingredients and steps and it was still a tasty dish and I think even a new staple. I was struggling to adapt to cooking for a full Italian family who have some specific food requirements and its a heatwave and I believe your recipes have me back on track, trying to make all your salads. Thank you so much!!",
				"What a delicious summer salad!  I love farro, and I love the chewy texture it adds to this salad.  I also really loved that the corn and zucchini are charred- it just adds an extra layer of flavor. I try not to use oil, so I left it out of the dressing and it was still delicious!  I can see myself taking this to cookouts and potlucks this summer!  Great dish!",
				"I have made this delicious recipe twice now, and I did 'tweak' it a bit....  When I was making the dressing I still had on the char grill pan so I put the lemon that I was using (cut in half) and char grilled it. When the lemon was all nice and grilled I then juiced it and used it in the dressing, the result was a mellow buy beautiful lemon flavor. Next time you make this you could give this a try and see if you like it. Thank you for another great recipe. Greeting from Australia where it is very hot at the moment (26/1)",
				"Looking forward to try this recipe \ud83e\udd29 However, I've never seen farro where I live (and I looked around a lot for it), so I was thinking of switching with wheat berries instead.",
				"Do you think I could swap the farro for perl barley or spelt? Would they have the right consistency? This looks fab though, I am excited to try!",
				"Really delicious.  Lovely summer flavours :-) Thanks so much!",
				"This was delicious, thank you. You have a knack for knowing exactly what's in my garden and kitchen at any moment and helping me make something lovely with it! Another reason to look forward to more get-togethers - this would be perfect for a summer potluck.",
				"Will be making this soon i never had salad before perfect for my after office meals will dm you if i amke this and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya"

						"35 g / 3 tbsp sugar (coconut sugar if refined sugar-free)",
						"approx. 160 ml / 2/3 cup lukewarm plant milk",

			"recipe": [
				{
					"FILLING": [
						"1. Place all the liquids at the bottom of your blender. If using vegan butter or hardened coconut oil, soften it a little first. If using sugar (other than icing sugar), dissolve it in 80 ml / 1/3 cup plant milk first. If using maple syrup, you may need to add an extra 1-2 tbsp plant milk to loosen the cream.",
						"2. Blend in drained and rinsed cashews until the mixture is silky smooth. As opposed to other cashew creams I  made on here, this mixture needs to be fairly loose as this allows for some of the moisture to evaporate during baking and prevents the filling from drying out too much."
					]
				},
				{
					"DOUGH": [
						"1. Mix the flour, salt, instant yeast and sugar in a large mixing bowl.",
						"2. Pour in most of the plant milk (hold back 1 tbsp). If using maple syrup instead of sugar, adjust the amount of plant milk accordingly. Bring all the ingredients together with a wooden spoon.",
						"3. When the mixture has mostly stuck together, turn the mixture out on to a work surface. If the mixture feels dry, add the rest of plant milk. The dough should be a little sticky initially but quite easy to work with.",
						"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. Reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 5 minutes.",
						"5. Work the coconut oil (no need to melt it) into the dough. To begin with the dough will be slippery and will look like it\u2019s been ruined. Keep working it and eventually all the fat will get absorbed by the dough and it will become elastic and smooth (it takes about 10 minutes) .",
						"6. Put the dough in a large clean bowl, coat it in a thin layer of oil and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside, in a warm (but not too warm) place for 1-1\u00bd hours, until the dough doubles in size.",
						"7. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 6-7 identical portions.",
						"8. Roll each portion into a ball, place them in a lightly oiled baking tray and cover with a kitchen towel. Set aside for about 30-45 minutes, until the balls rise again slightly.",
						"9. Heat up the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.",
						"10. Flatten each ball with your hand then press a lightly oiled glass bottom into each ball to create a deep indent for the filling. If the dough springs back (which it should), use your fingers to perfect the shape of the indent. Fill with the sweet \u2018cheese\u2019 mixture you\u2019ve made earlier and top with berries.",
						"11. Brush the dough (not the filling) with a mixture of plant milk and maple syrup. Bake for about 20 minutes. Brush with a little maple syrup (or sugar syrup) while still hot for that bakery shine."

If the mixture is too wet, add a touch more flour, but don\u2019t go crazy, especially if you intend to bake your meatballs, as baking will dry them out a bit more than frying.",

Have you tried it sliced up keeping base intact, saut\u00e9ed in oil till browned, 16 whole peeled garlic cloves added, a bit longer.. then 1 cup of veg stock and pepper.. bring to boil, cover simmer 15 minutes. Watch liquid levels. Then throw in a can of chopped tomatoes and boil vigorously to reduce a little. Parsley in quantities and vegan cheese to finish.. good on any carb including instant  polenta.",

It is good to understand what it is like to be a top notch internet siter and does sound like a treadmill from your description\u2026 I for one would be equally happy with photos of your new bathroom, WIP shots, or the lounge wall colour or your garden or the the eponymous lazy cat of great fame.

				"Tonight I will make this lovely recipe. I made the Baked Gnocchi. The bomb! I am going to try the no-bake cheesecake in those lovely jarsyou have from Greece. I'll stemless wine glasses. Thanks for the fabulous ideas.",
				"I found this recipe to be good. I used vegetable broth I get from Trader Joe\u2019s. I also grabbed some canned artichokes but I do my best in getting those with the least or no preservatives. It does have a tad bit of acidity due to the citric acid but I balanced with the almond milk and vegetable broth. I also added some sun dried tomatoes and 2 extra cloves of garlic. As a true Caribe\u00f1a, we use lime more than lemon, so I used that and it was fine.",
				"I am having a hard time finding the yeast any suggestions?",
				"Many of the canned/jarred artichokes sold in the United States are packed in brine, which can be fairly acidic and sour. I love that you can find already-grilled artichokes packed in oil in the UK! I'll have to check some specialty stores near where I live. This recipe looks amazing!",
				"The artichokes itself was sour. The pasta sauce was beautiful!  I will try again with the same artichokes you used. \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I finally made this last night. It was my first time eating artichokes and I wasn\u2019t big fun of it haha it was a bit too sour for me but the rest was very nice as always!  Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Hello :) This dish looks so tasty! Can I please ask which brand of artichokes did you use? I couldn\u2019t find any around my neighborhood so I want to order online.  Thank you x",
				"Thank you for this recipe!  It's so delicious and easy to prepare!",

I added three dates chopped to bring a bit more sweetness as my bananas were not really ripe. And instead of ginger stems (that are hard to find in Brazil) I used a little bit of ginger powder to give it a little kick. And I also wanted to tell you how much I respect your work. All recipes that I have tried so far are of very high quality. I do realize how much work it is to perfect it to this level.

Thank you for sharing!",

				"I am starting to realize now that not all sugars are made equal...lol I will keep your  information in mind... oh, and maple butter is basically maple syrup mixed with some oil (think of a healthy oil) and it has marmalade like consistency that you can spread on anything from toasted bread to pancakes or waffles for breakfast  (similar to honey & butter mix)... I'm getting hungry as I type all this. Thanks, Ania!",
				"Hi Ania, yes the homegrown strawberries have so much flavour and you pick them at the peak ripeness when they are the sweetest and most fragrant! For the cookies, I used  \"maple sugar\" - it has almost powder-like consistency and it is made from maple syrup and it is even more expensive than the syrup. I live in Canada - the country of  everything Maple...lol so there is plenty of varieties of maple products - different grades maple syrup, maple candies, maple butters, maple sugar... I thought maple sugar will behave the same way as regular granulated sugar. I will try the cookies next time with the regular sugar (maybe coconut sugar). Thank you! :)",
				"Hi Ania, so it turned out mom did have tapioca starch and after the strawberry picking we made the dessert  at her place and in 2 doses - one with the 4 tsp tapioca per the recipe and one with only 1 tsp. I personally liked it creamier - the version with 1 tsp tapioca or maybe next  time I will just skip it altogether since I am all into moussy creamy consistency :)The biscuits turned ok an didn't  spread in the oven as others have noted. But I did use maple sugar as a sweetener (it melts better into the coconut oil), where the package says that it is twice as sweet as sugar, so I only  used half the recipe amount (1.5 Tbsp) but at the end they weren't  that sweet, so maybe next time I will  use the recipe amount (3 Tbsp). Also, it took longer than 30min for the biscuits to bake - maybe because they were cold from the fridge straight into the oven?!The final product was very yummy and a real treat after the strawberry picking! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"I  was wondering if I can use Xanthan Gum or Arrow root starch instead of Tapioca starch (only because I don't have any tapioca at the moment)? Going strawberry picking tomorrow and decided to try your recipe :)",
				"Hiya, Okay so  I made these last night - and despite my blender exploding everywhere (it's time; I have to face the fact to buy a new one! ) - they were delish! I didn't have any fresh strawberries so I stewed some apples with cinnamon, cardamom and date caramel and tossed some fresh raspberries in there. I also skipped the tofu and did a mixture of your previous cheesecake jar recipes and just used cashews , coconut cream and added the tapioca.Now, the shortbread are delish! I made 2 batches in 2 days! But, I had a bit of a problem with th first batch's batter consistency- it was very wet.. I used coconut oil and I think it may have been too runny as opposed the softened coconut oil as mentioned in the recipe? So I ended up adding quite a bit more GF flour so that I could handle it.I chilled them for a bit (less than 30mins) and popped them in the oven... Unfortunately they spread out a lot and I thought it was maybe because I hadn't chilled them properly. I ate them all in any case - because - still delicious!!The following day and 2nd batch I made sure my coconut oil wasn't so melted and the batter definitely seemed as it should be..So I popped the rolled biscuits to chill a full 30 mins or more.But they spread even more jn the oven than the other ones... Do you have any idea where I may have gone wrong?- I did use coconut sugar.- I also chilled the prebaked biscuits on the tray I used to bake them on..could it be that?I mean either way, they are absolutely delicious (did I mention that already!!) And have that perfect mouth watering crunch and moreishness of shortbread...hemce why I thought Id give a 3rd day of testing them a miss... ;)Thank you once again for another smashing recipe! Xx",
				"This looks amazing! I am in Australian and, strangely, winter is out best season for strawberries. Which is great because it is winter right now! Also excited to see that the cheesecake layer does not have coconut oil or coconut cream in it, and that the shortbread can be made with vegan butter. My coconut fat intolerant self thanks you!",
				"500 g is closer to 1 lb. Could you clarify which is correct? I know this isn\u2019t a very \u201cmeasured\u2019 part of the recipe, but I\u2019m sure the ratio of strawberries to cheesecake also makes a difference! Many thanks. Can\u2019t wait to try this one!",
				"Oh dear, I'm afraid I've got to diagnose myself with a hopelessly uncontrollable case of mouth-watering now...",
				"Can this be made with almonds? My daughter is  cashew intolerant",
				"Oh yummy yum yum! These look delish! X",

Season with soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and wasabi (diluted in a little water first if using powder, follow the instructions on the packet) to taste. Add a splash of water if the filling is too dry and crumbly. Allow it to cool down."

						"1. Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Pour in hot water while mixing it into the flour with a pair of chopsticks. Once combined roughly, bring the dough together using your hands and then transfer to a lightly floured surface. You may need to add a touch more water if the dough is too dry but be sure to add it in gradually, in very small amounts.",
						"2. Knead the dough for a few minutes until elastic and smooth.",
						"3. Set the dough aside for 30 minutes under a clean kitchen towel or pierced (so that it can breathe) cling film so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"4. Divide the dough into quarters. Cover three portions of the dough with a damp kitchen towel while you work on the forth. Roll the dough into a snake and then divide it into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a  small ball, flatten with your palm and then using a straight rolling pin, roll each disc into a thin wrapper. Ideally, you want the edges thinner than the middle following a \u2018roll and turn\u2019 technique (see this video).\nPlace a heaped teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of the wrapper and seal the dough over the filling at the top. You can simple fold them into half-moons or use a more intricate pleating pattern. I found this video helpful.\nArrange the finished dumplings, seam up, on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.\nHeat up a little (I used 10 ml / 2 tsp per 10 dumplings) oil in a large frying pan that you have a lid for. Choose a reliable non-sticking pan \u2013 I use a stainless steel pan and it works well. Once the oil is hot, arrange as many potstickers as you can without them touching each other. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add a splash of water to the pan (1 cm) and put the lid on. Let the dumplings cook in their own steam for about 6-8 minutes \u2013 depending on how thin your dough is. Once all the water has cooked out, take the lid off and leave the potstickers on heat for another minute or two so that any excess water evaporates and the bottoms turn nice and crispy.\nArrange cooked potstickers with crispy bottoms up while you cook the remaining batches.\nServe with a drizzle of chilli oil mixed with in with a small amount of soy sauce or tamari."

I\u2019d like to make them again today, however, I\u2019ve run out of spelt flour.. would normal plain flour work, or might it affect the texture or something? I also have some strong wholemeal bread flour which I could add a little of, should it help! Thank you so much!",

				"I have this a try as I had so much beetroot growing in the garden. It\u2019s a lovely recipe, especially if you love chocolate cake but don\u2019t want something sickly or overly sweet. The earthy tone of beetroot offsets the sweetness of the cocoa. And the ganache is really gorgeous. I think I put too much coconut milk in mine, so added two tablespoons of icing sugar to thicken it- it was perfect. The cake was so soft and moist, will definitely use this recipe again.",
				"I had grown some beetroot and it was my dad's birthday so decided to give this a go. It was delicious.  Really easy to follow and a nice looking, tasty cake. It's quite an 'adult'/sophisticated cake rather than one for a children's party. Good earthy undertones that stop it being too sweet. Nice and moist.  Lovely!",
				"Tried it yesterday without the ganache, just sprinkling icing sugar and freeze dried raspberries on top and it still worked, very tasty and chocolaty",

				"Having tried many cakes to adjust for gluten free and vegan, I was rather sceptical with this but having had success with other recipes on this site, I had to give it a try! It was a fantastic decision and was perhaps the best cake that I have made in years. The texture and taste was fantastic whilst being safe to eat as gluten free! Thank you again for stretching my confidence with baking.",

I made it as a loaf to test whether it would keep for 3 days out the fridge-it is absolutely fine out of the fridge, in a container.It is so moist, yet fluffy, rich, deep, fudgey and earthy!I made half the cake recipe yesterday with half the ganache recipe in cupcake style, baked for about 18-22 mins... absolutely stunning! I highly recommend this! Thank you so much Ania once again for a fab recipe! On point! I did tag you in my Insta, so you could see my results but not sure if it appeared your side... You must be proud of this one!Thank you! X",
				"This cake is amazing. Moist, rich, super chocolatey but not too sweet. I used olive oil and fine spelt flour and it turned out great.

The problem whe  doing this is refraining ourselves from eating yummy tempting things!!Will let you know how it pans out! Looks gorgeous though! X",

I flipping love your website and always look to your recipes when Im in a pickle of what to do!They pretty much are always a success! Thank you for all your amazing creations! X",
				"I made this today, and it was delicious! Very moist and chocolatey , but not as sweet as I expected, and very rich! So, next time I think I will add some of the sweetened tart cherries I have to the batter to give it a little contrast. I made the following modifications out of laziness and it still turned out great! I can't make a direct comparison to the original though since this was my first time making it. + I used canned beets and (light) olive oil. + Instead of sifting and mixing it in batches, I just added everything to the stand mixer and mixed it on low until it was mostly smooth. + I used a square cake pan (I think 8x8?)  and baked it for about half the time. + I made the ganache, but used almond milk instead of coconut milk.",

Very quick and easy!I left the chocolate ganache off because I felt it would be too rich. I happened to have some cooked raspberries with a bit of sugar which went very well with it.",
				"Would I be able to use cooked beetroot instead of raw in the recipe?",
				"So good! I used chocolate oat milk  for the plant milk and added  a handful of mini chocolate chips. I had  cooked beets and proceeded as written, worked. I frosted with  a vegan buttercream with almond extract and  an tablespoon of  sprinkles. I tripled the recouped and made three 11 by 7  sheet cakes, one for the day and the rest  for our freezer. My sons declared \u201c this tastes like an excellent birthday cake!\u201d",

This cake is next on my baking list, as I have beetroots in the fridge, we love chocolate cake and the weather is horrible here in Belgium today as well (and grey, dark, windy and wet weather surely does affect my mood). We were on holiday last week (also in Belgium) and unfortunately it rained every single day... but not the whole day, and occasionally from time to time the sun came out (so I guess we were lucky!).",

The raw peanuts I used still had skins, however these were easily removed after roasting them in the oven (which my daughter happily helped me with.) I also didn't sprinkle the salt on at the end as I don't like salty chocolate. Husband & son thought it wasn't sweet enough but I will definitely be making this again (for the girls!)",

						"1. Place drained cashews in a food processor (an upright blender will work too and give you a creamier texture, but you may need to use a tamper as the mixture is meant to be quite thick).",
						"2. Add 80 ml / 1/3 cup of water, 60 ml / \u00bc cup lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp of nutritional yeast and \u00bd tsp salt and one garlic clove, process or blend until smooth, scraping the sides of the machine as you go along to make sure the mixture is creamy and uniform \u2013 a little texture is fine.",
						"3. Cook the spinach by blanching it in batches for about 40 seconds and then plunging it into a bowl of ice-cold water (to stop it from cooking any further).",
						"4. Wring cold spinach dry (that\u2019s very important as otherwise the pie will be soggy) using your hands or a kitchen towel \u2013 be very thorough. Chop the spinach finely afterwards.",
						"5. Heat up a tablespoon of olive oil in a small pan, gently stir-fry the spring onions (apart from the green tops, add them directly to the filling \u2013 I used half of them) and garlic until softened and fragrant. Cool them down.",
						"6. In a large bowl, mix the cashew mixture with chopped spinach, lemon zest, finely chopped herbs, nutmeg, black pepper, 2 tbsp nutritional yeast, softened garlic and spring onions. Mix everything really well, taste the mixture and add more salt if needed (I used another heaped \u00bd tsp) and more lemon juice (I added 1 tablespoon)."

						"1. Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C fan / 355\u00b0 F fan (or 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F without a fan, although I recommend using a fan \u2013 it helps to crisp the pastry up) and grease your baking tin with olive oil.",
						"2. Line the tin with the first sheet of pastry allowing the excess to rest against the sides of the tin. Brush the pastry with some olive oil and place another sheet on top. Continue in this manner until you\u2019ve used up approximately a third of your pastry sheets making sure the sheets you are not working with are covered with a damp kitchen towel so that they do not dry out.",
						"3. Spread the filling on top of the pastry, levelling it out with a spatula.",
						"4. Fold the excess pastry from the bottom sheets over the filling to tuck it in. Next, start covering the top with more pastry sheets, brushing each sheet with olive oil as you go along. Trim the sheets you are putting on top of the filling to size, alternating using whole sheets with two half sheets, brushing with oil between each layer.",
						"5. Brush the final layer with oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds (if using). Using a sharp knife scour the dish so that the pastry puffs up during baking and it is easier to cut it into slices later. Try not to cut into the filling underneath as it will dry out too much.",
						"6. Bake for approximately 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. Allow the pie to \u2018set\u2019 for 30 minutes or so before cutting into it. It\u2019s best after it has been made but you can store the leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days in an air-tight container."

				"Hi! Do you know how long the \"cheese\" mixture will stay fresh for? I would love to make this for a party, and I'm trying to work smart by making certain things ahead of time. (Thanks in advance - I'm very excited to try a childhood favourite of mine in vegan form!)",
				"Hi Ania and Duncan,I tried making this recipe for Mother\u2019s Day today as I am aspiring to transition to a vegan diet (so far I am a flexitarian, meaning that I am mostly vegetarian unless I couldn\u2019t find any vegetarian or vegan options). I baked it for 37 minutes and I was so pleased to see the pastry turning almost completely golden brown by the thirtieth minute. The taste was also very delicious as I could feel the spinach taste in my mouth. I hope that the both of you will continue this awesome blog, and I am especially looking forward to you veganising more non-vegan dishes (including feta cheese and crab meat)!Thank you (Efcharisto)!",
				"Delicious. I swapped out some of the green onions for leeks I had in the fridge and doubled the garlic as I usually do, but excellent recipe. Will make again! And again and again\u2026 Thank you!",
				"Hi, Can you tell me which brand of vegan phyllo you used?",
				"Hi :) This recipe looks soo good. I was wondering if I can freeze my leftovers and if so, what kind of reheating method would you recommend (microwave or oven)?",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! I used to make standard veggie spanakopita a lot for family celebrations, but since going vegan 8 years ago I haven't been able to find a good vegan recipe for it (although I have found some really dodgy ones!). Your recipe turned out brilliantly, for a late Christmas family celebration. My son who's an omnivorous chef even said he preferred it to my old feta-based version!",
				"It\u2019s takes some time to make but was so worth it! Everyone at the table, vegan and non-vegan, loved  it! Thank you Ania \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9b\u2728",
				"This was delicious!  It kept really well in the fridge too.  As good as, if not better than, any dairy-filled version I've tried in the past.  I can imagine the filling making a really good open tart as well, with some tweaks to the proportions, and maybe some pine nuts sprinkled over.",
				"Had this for dinner tonight and it was loved  by all!  Thanks for the recipe.",
				"You're absolutely right... the method was easy, just time-consuming. Worth it, though!",
				"Delicious!!! But I would not label it as easy. Ended up being three different sessions of prep work. Was thrilled with the result anyhow! It even tempted me to taste-test comparison to \"real\" spanakopita with my 10% non-plant-based ration for the week, and I was still impressed. I made the mistake of tasting the cashew filling out of the blender and almost quit right then. Thankfully, something magical happened after step 2. Fair warning to others--ignore the temptation and power through.",

I was born in, and grew up in Chester , Cheshire till I emigrated to Canada just before my 24th birthday, and almost 53 years ago!",

				"3. Set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. A longer resting time makes it easier to form the falafels.",

				"5. Brush small circles of olive oil onto the baking paper at regular intervals, keeping ample space around each falafel so that the browning process isn\u2019t inhibited through too much moisture. I recommend baking 10-12 at a time.",
				"6. Using your hands, form small patties (1 heaped tbsp worth / 28 g each) or balls with your hands or using a small ice cream scoop. I like to shape mine into 2 cm / \u00be\u201d tall and 4 cm / 1\u00bd\u201d diameter discs. The mixture will be fairly wet so handle it gently, but don\u2019t be tempted to add more flour \u2013 it will make the falafels dry. Apply some sesame seeds to the underside of each falafel with your hand before placing it on the oiled area of your baking paper. Apply more sesame seeds to the tops.",
				"7. Bake for 12 minutes. Take the tray out of the oven, gently lift each falafel off the surface using a spatula. Brush a little oil on before placing the other side of the falafels down. Brush the tops with some more olive oil for extra crispiness and bake for another 12 minutes until the tops are golden brown.",
				"8. Enjoy them warm, in a hummus wrap or as part of a salad bowl. The mixture keep in the fridge for 2-3 days and freezes well."

They were a bit too lemony for my husband\u2019s taste but that might be due to our fantastic microplane grater and the large size lemon in my pantry.",

				"Thank you, Ania, for these amazing morsels!Made these as part of a picnic meal when it was too hot to cook. I didn't have rice flour so used about half to 3-quarters of the amount of cornflour which worked well. And I used a tin of chickpeas, drained well. I didn't have any seeds and I baked them on paper with no oil and they worked perfectly, crisp on the outside and lovely and moist on the inside. Full of flavour and a beautiful colour. Even my beetroot doubting son raved about these as the flavour is spicy rather than earthy, but the sweetness of the beetroot is a lovely addition. We'll be making these again, simple and delicious and so much better than standard dry and crumbly falafels of any description! My only niggle is that my food processor bowl couldn't cope with the volume so next time I'll mix them up in 2 batches. Just wondering if the mixture is freezable for camping trips?Cheers :0)",

Like you I am oil phobic - or at least the amount of oil a tradional falafel requires.  But falafel 's are my favourite food, what would a girl do, without a friend like you!",

				"Hi Ania,This looks absolutely super delicious - gorgeous photos - and I shall have a go at your recipe for tomorrow's Sunday dinner. The stew reminds me of a dish I enjoyed in Crete many years ago. Greek food - a rather underrated cuisine methinks - is simply the best, particularly the vegetarian (and fish) dishes. I do plan to use store-bought, cooked chick peas, but I'm wondering, do I need to heat them in advance or do I just throw them in? But when do I do that? And how long should the stew cook in all? Also, if I add cubed potatoes, I take it you mean raw, cubed potatoes? Lots of questions, sorry about that. Hope to hear from you. \u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd! Meanwhile, let me put a bottle of retsina in the refrigerator... Best,Hansxx",
				"This was sooooo good.  It even tasted better the next day.  I only used two cans of chickpeas which came to 2 cups and that seemed like enough.   Do you think it freezes well?",
				"This stew was enjoyed by everyone!  It was easy to prepare and full of flavour. I especially appreciated the citrus which brought some sunniness to our endless end of winter days",
				"Absolutely delicious! Make sure to cook enough to yield leftovers and leave the lemon peels in overnight - it's even better the next day! Super simple to make, the ingredients going in are few and humble but the resulting flavours are out of this world. I recommended it to friends and family already and I will certainly be making it again for me and my partner! Thanks Ania, I love your recipes and photos :)",
				"I made this recipe and added cumin for an extra kick.  It is delicious hot or cold.  I tossed over baby spinach and made a salad. It\u2019s a versatile recipe.",
				"Finally I got to try this for vegan Mondays. Absolutely amazing combo of flavors; a festival in mouth. And best of all is easy and quick. Thank you!",
				"Amazing, amazing, amazing! This is my go to dish whenever I want to impress non vegans or just want to have tasty ball of greatness for myself and my husband (my kids are not yet into vegan food). And the quality of this recipe is really of high restaurant standards! Sometimes I cook it just with onions if I dont have leaks or shallot handy. Thank you, Ania for making delicious food of the greatest quality available to everybody!",
				"This stew was amazing!! It was bright, creamy and soul satisfying. Ania, your recipes never disappoint, you have been my go to since my husband and I went plant based 5 years ago. Your recipes are full of flavor and texture and such a great variety of types of cuisine. Thank you!",
				"Really really good idea for adding creaminess with the plant milk! I find it also a good idea to cook the chickpeas separately, because I make a big pot and store in servings in the freezer. Tahini is great addition too in the end!!!Very delicious! And I think spinach will be the go to green for me! And I also like your stories accompanying the recipes!Thank you",
				"No I think your stories are so honest and written with a very nice attitude, not to impress or invoke emotions or anything, very human and relaxing to read. And I love that your recipes are also unique and come from you, not stealing from others. So thank you for all your work! We really enjoy learning to cook better, getting new ideas and reading about your interestsing experiences and fun stories!",

				"Just made this and its AMAZING!!!. will definitely be making gain",
				"A very tasty soup. Haven't roasted garlic many times but it was so good for this recipe. We had this for dinner with your tomato fritters on the side.",
				"This stew is so delicious and filling. It comes together really easily too. I had never tried  a stew or soup with lemony flavor before but it\u2019s brilliant! The lemon provides a bright note that takes the stew to a whole new level! I\u2019m going to be making this often!",
				"This is so delicious! I didn\u2019t have the large potatoes so I just use tiny Yukon gold on top. Will make this again!",
				"Loved this! It is a nice blend of flavors, easy to make, and perfect for in-between weather.",
				"Everyone in my family loved this stew even the non-vegans!  We will  definitely  be making this again and again. We always have some type of greens we are happy to use up by wilting into a soup or stew . I loved the brightness the lemon brought to the flavors.",
				"Hi Ania - I am new to your blog and this is the first recipe of yours I made and it was so delicious! I made it a day ahead during my Saturday meal prep and ate it last night - so good! I cooked my chickpeas from scratch so added a couple of tablespoons of aquafaba when I processed 1/3 of the chickpeas with the milk. I used Silk soy organic unsweetened and instead of tahini I soaked 2 tablespoons of walnuts in hot water for a couple of hours and blended them with the chickpeas, garlic and milk. It was easy to prepare and the flavors were so good! I will definitely be making this again. Next up from your blog I want to make the coconut tofu with green beans and the miso chickpeas. Thank you for posting and sharing.",
				"OMG! this was so good, and very easy to make. Not obvious, surprising, very refreshing  flavours. I was sceptic about adding whole garlic, but believe me, once you blend it with chickpea and plant milk, it gives very smooth, delicate texture and stron smell disappears. I used almond milk. Definitely this dish will be repeated soon! <3",
				"Delicious! Really enjoyed this and it's very different to anything I've made before. Yummy with the crusty bread and added chili oil drizzled on top! I also added a few \"meat\" balls for extra protein.",
				"It really turned out delicious. And that smell when you open the roasted garlic wraps... Sooooo good! \ud83d\ude0d (I ran out of chickpeas so made the stew with cannellini beans which made it ever so creamy \ud83d\ude00) Thanks for the recipe!",
				"This was just what I was looking to have for dinner this evening and it is super delicious! Your recipes always turn out fantastically. Great depth of flavou, even though I\u2019m currently cooking without oil and salt ( I did add miso to my bowl after serving). A great way to use up greens -  and even if like me you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t usually like creamy dishes, give this one a go (I used oatly\u2019s oat cream for that step). Thank you \u2764\ufe0f will definitely be making this again!!!",
				"My go-to comfort food is egg-lemon soup, but this recipe takes that soup up a notch. Can't wait to try it! Thank you for the recipe.",
				"Will be making this soon i never had greek food before perfect with naan will dm you if i make this and let you k ow how it goes Thanks Ramya"

				"These are so delicious and easy to make! I swapped the chickpea flour for normal white flour and it worked fine (just not GF anymore). I\u2019ll be tripling the recipe and making this a dinner staple for sure",
				"Absolutely delish, healthy and super easy. Thank you! Would love more soaked legume/grain recipes like this....Soaked green buckwheat makes THE BEST GF baked goodies without any other fancy ingredients or insane preparation. Just blend and bake...yum!",
				"Thanks, I have never seen those type of lentils here, but I will look again:)",
				"I Will make these! Thank you Ania for the inspiration. I am doning a fitness challenge and these seem perfect as a prote\u00efn packed meal!",
				"The pancakes were so goooood! Amazing recipe! IThank you so much for this <3",
				"The pancakes were a disaster! I couldn't  turn them, they fell to pieces , the last pancake was the best of a poor bunch!",
				"Thank you for the recipe! Is the batter supposed to be completely smooth?  I couldn't get mine to be creamy, there were still tiny lentil bits left even though I was blending for 10 minutes straight. Lentils were soaking for 12 hours prior.",
				"Are there different kinds of red lentils? the ones I usually get do not normally require soaking, only cooking for about 5-10 minutes. They are simply called \"red lentils\" in the shop. I want to try this.",
				"I just made the dosa, they're delicious! I made my own filling with spinach and some cherrytomatoes, with a lot of spices and onion and garlic. Will try your fillings soon, thank you for the recipe!",
				"HiGreat recipe.Can I use different flour?",
				"will be making this soon perfect for my office snacks will dm you  if i make this and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya",
				"Hallo,Could french PUY lentils be used instead ? This recipe sounds delicious :)Thanks,Phyllis"

				"1. Place white chocolate and coconut oil in a metal or glass bowl suspended over a bain-marie / water bath. Melt very slowly (on a low heat) and make sure the bowl with the chocolate does not touch the water underneath as chocolate does not tolerate intense heat.",
				"2. Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Line a 20 cm x 20 cm / 8 inch x 8 inch baking tin with baking parchment. Make the baking parchment stick out of the tin so that you\u2019re able to remove the brownies from the tin a little easier.",
				"3. Whip aquafaba with an electric whisk until you have a stable foam (there is no need to achieve stiff peaks for this recipe).",
				"4. Gradually add sugar to the aquafaba, whisking well after each addition. By the time you are done the mixture should be thick with sugar and with lots of tiny bubbles.",
				"5. Using a spatula, fold melted, lukewarm but not hot, chocolate and coconut oil mixture into the aquafaba mixture.",
				"6. Place a sieve over the bowl and sift through all of the dry ingredients in batches, folding in gently until no flour pockets remain.",
				"7. Transfer the\u00a0batter into the prepared baking tin. Scatter the top with frozen raspberries and chocolate chunks if you like.",
				"8. Bake on the middle shelf for about 29-30 minutes. Similarly to brownies, it is better to underbake these a touch than overbake them.",
				"9. Allow the blondies to cool down completely (!) before cutting with a sharp knife. Store in an air tight container as these will wick moisture out of the air."

				"Hello, I have a question please - couldn't figure out how to undo the star rating so I hope you see it!  This is a lovely recipe but I don't think I did it quite right.I have a handheld electric whisk and I was not sure what \"stable foam\" means for the aquafaba. Mine may have still been too liquid when I added the sugar. It never went whitish and it couldn't be described as \"thick with sugar\".  However, the end product is moist and delicious if a little flat.  I would love to do it better next time and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Thanks!!!!!",
				"Hi AniaThese blondies looks fab! What white chocolate brand would you recommend? Many brands (I tried ichock)  use nuts blends, such as cashews and tiger nuts to make chocolate creamy, but this, in my opinion, doesn't work very well when trying to melt chocolate .Any suggestions please?",

				"This is going to be my go-to galette recipe since my default flour is spelt. It's so easy and flaky that I made it twice in a row with different veggies. I don't have a food processor so I put my bowl of flour and salt in the freezer before rubbing the fat in with my fingers. I used distilled vinegar for the dough and soy milk for the cashew filling. I once swapped out a little spelt flour for corn flour for a subtle sweetness.  When stone fruits and berries are in season, I'm definitely going to make a sweet galette with this dough. Thank you, Ania, for such a lovely and versatile recipe!",

It turned out perfect and  it tasted very good.  We ate it with fresh berries and it was delicious ! Thank you for this great recipe !",

I let it cool down in the kitchen then transferred to the fridge for further setting up. We had a slice last night. Perfect!",

Give the sauce a good stir from time to time, add a splash more water if the pan is looking too dry.\nOnce the tomatoes break down fully, stir in cooked lentils. If the ragu is too dry, add a little water as it will dry out more during baking.\nAdjust the seasoning and add a touch of sweetness if desired. Set aside to cool."

					"BECHAMEL": [
						"1. Measure out the milk. Blend roasted garlic cloves and miso paste with 120 ml / \u00bd cup of the oat milk allocated for the b\u00e9chamel sauce.",
						"2. Slowly heat up olive oil in a large saucepan (stainless steal works best for this). Once the oil starts to shimmer, gradually whisk in flour. Keep whisking until the mixture is super smooth. Allow the mixture to bubble gently, whisking the whole time, for a few minutes so that there is no raw flour taste in your b\u00e9chamel, but make sure it doesn\u2019t colour.",
						"3. Next, reduce the heat to low and start adding in oat milk while whisking the whole time. Initially the mixture may thicken really quickly and look a bit lumpy \u2013 don\u2019t worry, it will recover once all the milk has been whisked in. Once the mixture looks stable whisk in nutritional yeast and allow it to melt into the sauce, then continue adding in the rest of your milk, including the batch you\u2019ve whizzed up with garlic and miso. Simmer only just enough for the sauce to thicken then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste."

						"3. Spread ragu on top of the pasta, followed by the b\u00e9chamel.",
						"4. Bake for about 50 minutes, rotating the dish halfway through cooking to ensure it bakes evenly. Increase the oven temperature by 10\u00b0 C / 35\u00b0 F for the last 10 minutes of baking time to speed up browning.",
						"5. Allow the dish to set for at least an hour or else the slices will come out messy, although I do recommend waiting to consume until the following day \u2013 the flavours will mellow and the dish will taste even better. Store the leftovers for up to 5 days in the fridge or freeze in air-tight containers."

				"I am having my very first vegan dinner party next week and am thinking of cooking this for my main! One of the guests isn't keen on mushrooms though - do you think it would work with TVP mince in the Ragu instead?Can't wait to try it! My mouth is already watering! Xxx",
				"Thanks so much Ania! Will definitely try that!I have a couple more questions if thats ok! Ive managed to find a 25cm square dish but it looks a bit shallower than yours - do you have the depth of the dish you used please?Also I noted that you serve it at room temp or slightly warmer - do you have to prep your guests in advance so theyre not expecting something super hot like a normal lasagna?Sorry for all the silly questions!Lu x",
				"Love all of your recipes! This one in particular is a winner!!! Delicious!!! Couldn\u2019t wait the full hour before tucking in.. maybe around 20mins! Which worked out perfectly! Held its shape completely!! Making again!! And again! Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude0d",
				"Fancy, and delicious! I did use sunflower seeds and tofu to make the bechemel instead of flour and olive oil. Perfect! And the ragu was wonderful. Thank you!!",
				"This is absolutely delicious and easy to make!! The mushrooms add wonderful texture, the spices and bechamel make this a wonderful dish for the holidays or anytime really. It tastes even better the next day. Ania is the best, thank you for all of the amazing vegan dishes you share.",
				"Hello\u2026do I have to add the nutritional yeast to the b\u00e9chamel pls?",
				"Hi, what could I sub for Tapioca or could I just leave it out?",
				"I'd like to cook this for Christmas day, but my husband is allergic to mushrooms, what do you think might work instead?",
				"My husband, son and I absolutely loved this recipe. It was super tasty and it is definitely one I will make again. I also plan to make just the ragu to have with spaghetti and the bechamel to have with an Italian style lasagne. There are some leftovers but I daresay they will not last for long!",
				"Absolutely delicious! Used to love pastitio pre-vegan so this is such a treat to be able to have it again- the bechamel is amazing.",
				"Love this recipe ! So easy to make and great flavors.  I invited my vegan neighbors to enjoy and they loved it \ud83d\ude0a.  I will be making this again.",
				"Thanks for the inspiration for a fun few hours in the kitchen this afternoon! Prior to going vegan, pastitsio was what I always felt like making as it got close to the time of our town's annual Greek festival. Love the combination of mixed mushrooms and lentils. I added a few button mushrooms with the shiitake and cremini.  I like how it worked with ziti pasta boiled for just five minutes. I appreciate the pro tip to cook for half the package directions. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! Definitely will make this a few times a year.",
				"THIS IS MAGIC! Comfort food in a baking dish, and the unexpected spices add the best touch. I have yet to get my noodle base looking as perfect as the picture, but who cares? The result is amazing.",
				"Such a great recipe\u2014 a little involved, but a great Sunday project!  I made the bechamel with no oil!!!  I used 1 c oatmilk (leaving 2 c to add later) to suspend the flour.  I added 1 tbsp tapioca flour to help thicken it.  Turned out PERFECT.  Next time I might roast some carrots to add to the ragu\u2014 you can\u2019t have too much umami.  Everyone (15 yo daughter included)   Loved it.",
				"Made this for my Dad's birthday has he grew up loving pastitsio and is now vegan. We all absolutely loved it!!!! Thanks for this recipe.",
				"This dish was amazing! It had the perfect flavour profile and was a restaurant quality dish. My family of four devoured the whole thing in one sitting it was so good!",
				"I so appreciate your time and the links, thank you! I'm going to get some, can't wait, this is a game changer!",
				"So I didn't want to take up any more of your time and thought I'd just Google kombu, because I've never heard of it. I couldn't get a satisfactory answer. Would you mind telling me about it and how it helps? Do you use it with all beans?Thank you again!",
				"Thank you so much for the quick response, very helpful,  thank you!",
				"I made this for dinner last night, wowza, so good! It's a time investment, but so worth it. What do you think about adding dried lentils and extra water to the ragu while it's simmering, rather than add already cooked lentils at the end?",
				"Our daughter made this for us recently - it was amazing ! The ragu is so so tasty, I think this is definitely a dish that would win round vegan sceptic dinner guests. Thanks for sharing xx",
				"This was a hit in our house, we're not vegan, but are trying to eat more plant based, as much as possible. My meat loving, mushroom hating son even loved this one, so that's high praise indeed! Loads of flavour and full of umami, so we really loved this one and will do it again. Thanks!",
				"I've made this recipe today. Replaced lentils with whole mung beans and used fettuccine pasta. We eat lentils often, I just wanted some variety. The fettuccine was the only pasta I had at home. The recipe looks very complicated, but it is worth following exactly, if only to get the feel and taste of the intended result. I can think of many variations for that middle layer! I really liked the pasta trick - undercooking the pasta, then mixing with vege milk and tapioca. The pasta will be chewy and will stick together nicely. I let the pastitsio rest for 30 minutes before eating - we just couldn't resist the aroma :-P.If you cook the pasta first and then layer it in the baking dish, you can reuse the pot to make the top layer, saves on washing.",
				"Loved this thank you. This was always my favourite dish when in Greece when I ate meat and I'd never made it before so it seems right that the first time I do it's vegan. The flavours took me there and whilst it takes a while it was sooo good with left overs too, although not as much as other have said!",
				"Hi! Just finished making this - it looks amazing but there's loads!! Can I freeze it?",
				"Hi Ania!I recently discovered your blog and am equally enjoy your writing voice as much as your delicious recipes. I\u2019m a very intuitive vegan cook, mostly reading food blogs for inspiration. However this time I more or less followed this recipe. I admittedly cheated with a jar of marinara sauce and some Moroccan spice blend. Oh my goodness. After eating this dish for dinner three nights in a row my husband and I will be mourning the absence of it in our refrigerator. I found myself thinking about it in the late afternoons, asking myself it was too early for dinner. Definitely a new favorite to make for guests, a holiday, or a particularly bleak feeling Monday. Thank you!",
				"Ania, this is so delicious! I love this take on lasagne, the cinnamon and clove are such great flavors! This will be a family favouritw for us. Thabk you for the great recipes. Clare",
				"This dish was OUTSTANDING!!!!  The only thing I did differently was I substituted meatless crumbles for the lentils, as I don't really care for them.   The ragu was so flavorful and the Bechamel was so delicious that I'm going to use it in other recipes.   Thanks for sharing this!  Will make again and again.",
				"Absolutely wonderful. I made  a day ahead and reheated for Easter Dinner. The non-vegans were going back for seconds!  Thank you so much!",
				"My grandmother used to make Pastisio. I look forward to trying a vegan version!",
				"Do you eat this at room temperature then, or if you wait a day and store in the fridge - are you eating it cold? Thanks.",
				"this is something new for me, curious about it's taste.",
				"will be making this soon i never had greek lasagna before perfect for my after office meals  everyday will dm you if  i make this and let you know how it goes Thanks Ramya",
				"Hi  Ania, This recipe looks so good and compliant with my diet except for the nutritional yeast...what would be a good substitute ?"

						"1. Mix the flour, salt, yeast, sugar, spices and orange zest in a large mixing bowl.",

						"3. Make a well in the centre, add room temperature applesauce and melted (and cooled off) coconut oil and most of the warm plant milk \u2013 hold about \u00bc of it back as not all of it may be needed. Mix all three liquid ingredients in the centre roughly and then mix them into the dry ingredients using a wooden spoon. Switch to using your hands to bring the dough together, if the dough is too dry, trickle in more plant milk. The dough should feel a little sticky/tacky \u2013 higher level of dough hydration gives your buns a better rise so resist the temptation to add extra flour.",
						"4. Transfer the dough to the workbench and knead it for until elastic and smooth (it may take 10 minutes or more, depending on how good your kneading technique is).",
						"5. Shape into a ball and place in a large mixing bowl, coat in a thin layer of olive oil and cover the bowl with a tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm \u2013 IE not next to an open fire!) for between one and two hours (until it has doubled in size).",
						"6. Empty the dough out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",
						"7. Split the dough into twelve equal parts \u2013 best to use kitchen scales here.",
						"8. Shape each portion of the dough into a ball by pinching the dough so that the seam is at the bottom.",
						"9. Pre-heat the oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F. Lay the buns on a paper lined baking tray in a 3\u00d74 grid so that they just touch each other (they will merge with each other as they expand during proving). Cover with cling film and leave another 60 minutes for another proofing.",
						"10. While the buns are proofing for the second time, mix flour and a little water (about 60 ml / \u00bc cup) in a small bowl until you have a flour paste that runs off your spoon but only just, you don\u2019t want it too runny as the crosses won\u2019t stay on the buns.",
						"11. Just before the buns are ready for baking, put the flour paste in a piping bag and pipe crosses on top of of the buns.",
						"12. Place the buns in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until the buns are golden. You may need to rotate the tray after 15 minutes if your oven has visible hotspots."

The Whole Food Plant Based version of the chocolate is just as delicious as the original, no graininess at all. It is so good that DH decided to make his own with nuts and raisins, his favorite. Thank you Ania, commercially produced chocolate is now a thing of the past for us.",

It tends to not dissolve as completely as  other sugars due to its fiber but I am hoping that since the chocolate will contain lots of chopped nuts, any slight graininess from the sugar won\u2019t be noticeable. I will let you know. Thanks for some great recipes. Mary.",

I had no hazelnuts so I used organic almond butter and chopped up organic almonds. Delicious!  What a treat. Now I am going to experiment to see if I can make it Whole Food Plant Based, so no refined sugar.",

				"Hi Ania, I love your vegan recipes. Thank you for them. You said you are not sure if the chocolate can be tempered on this page because you added hazelnut butter. Well as a chocolatier I can answer that\ud83d\ude0a. The chocolate recipe if it is made with icing sugar or in my case because I am diabetic I use icing Swerve or any erythritol or powdered Allulose , then will temper easily because hazelnut butter is fat based. However,  if you use any liquids in the mix like maple syrup, the moisture or water content  of maple syrup or agave nectar will cease your cocoa butter and it turns into a sludge or mud like texture. For me a day without chocolate is a day without sunshine. So thank you for this recipe, I would temper mine and add two tablespoon of organic olive oil to the hazelnut butter to get a smoother texture and not melt in my hands so easily.Cheers,Hanna Baroncelli@fuchsiachocolatier"

						"4. Next, use your fingertips to rub coconut oil into the flour until the flour looks pebbly. Do not rush this step or take shortcuts if you are after light, nicely risen scones.",
						"5. Next add in extra ginger (if using, see NOTES), orange zest and very finely chopped stem or crystallized ginger. Mix everything well.",

Do not twist the cutter as that inhibits rising, simply apply a lot of pressure to the cutter and then lift the cutter with the scone inside. Place over the baking tray and gently pop the scone out onto the tray. I found that dipping the cutter in flour and then shaking the excess off helps a lot when it comes to releasing the scones onto the tray.",

						"11. Place the scones on the prepared baking tray, making sure there is some space around each one. Mix all the glaze ingredients together in a small bowl and glaze the tops of the scones with a pastry brush.",
						"12. Sprinkle each scone with some sugar (if using) and bake for 12-15 minutes. My oven heats the right hand side more than the left so after 12 minutes the ones on the right were done, but the other ones needed another 3 minutes. I rotated the tray before baking them for the last 3 minutes so that they were evenly browned on all sides.",
						"13. Let the scones cool down a little before cutting them in half with a serrated knife and filling them with coconut yoghurt and roasted rhubarb."

I had very similar pains and that's what it was. Mine had gotten very severe before I sought help though and the ER nurses were concerned I could have had sepsis! So scary.  Surgery was really a breeze, luckily, and fortunately we don't really need gallbladders. Anyway, these scones look amazing and I cannot wait to try them once our rhubarb is in!

I was a little concerned that they would be more difficult then what I wanted to take in for Sunday lunch but they were actually pretty easy and well worth the effort.  I made the recipe as stated and from the moment I started cooking the first one, we knew it would be a hit.  They smell exactly like real Turkish lamacun!!!  My only regret is not doubling the recipe.  So so good!",
				"I got so excited when I saw this recipe! I've never had traditional lahmacun, but always wanted to try one (minus meat). I've made this once with soy mince, but it was rather bland and the texture wasn't right. This recipe is a game changer! Even though I had neither pomegranate molasses nor roasted pepper (I used a couple of dried tomatoes, lemon juice and some ground walnuts ) it turned out so delicious! The tofu topping tasted very strong but it mellowed perfectly after baking and the texture was very nice too. I used some leftover flat bread dough and it worked great. Next time I'll try it with pizza dough! Thank you for a great recipe!",
				"Thanks for this recipe. It was very tasty. I have seen these often in street food markets in London but never found a vegan version. It was genuinely quick to make. I made the dough the night before and after that it took just over 50 minutes to prepare everything bake the pizzas as well as to tidy up and there was enough filling for two more meals as I was just making it for myself. The first time I used a sourdough for the bread but the next time I realised I did not have any yeast so I make a kind of quick bread dough mixing flour with vegan yogurt and baking soda. I just chopped all the vegetables, parsley and tofu finely and it worked well. I did not have pomegranate molasses so I added about a teaspoon of  anardana powder (ground dried pomegranate) for half a batch of the salad and used coconut sugar in place of date syrup in the filling. I didn't have pul biber either so used a couple of crushed dried chillis.",

I did make some alterations (because I can\u2019t seem to follow a recipe off the internet word-for-word even from a site like this one with well researched and tested recipes): I added 1/8t cinnamon because I love it in my oatmeal cookies and reduced salt by half because mom is on a low sodium diet. I also used half GF flour as mentioned in the notes (Bobs red mill 1:1 in my case). I also used half coconut oil and half Follow Your Heart soy-free vegan butter because that\u2019s what I had - which totally works in case someone is reading this and doesn\u2019t have or like coconut oil. So yummy, soft and delicious and EASY!

No taste of coconut anyways. I used only flour instead of the oat flour as suggested but simply because I didn't have oat flour. Thanks again for such a gorgeous vegan recipe.",

				"Really nice recipe, especially the sauce. I've made peanut satay sauce plenty of times before, but this one had an interesting edge quite unlike the other ones I've made. Highly recommend!",

				"What a great, fuss-free recipe and so satisfying too. I steamed my veggies as I try to use as little oil as possible and still the dish was so flavoursome. Thank you, Ania. I am a big fan of your recipes - keep them coming. Stephanie!",
				"I made this tonight and it was exceptional!  I didn\u2019t have edamame so subbed frozen sweet green peas. I wish I could add my picture. It was vibrant and filling."

We used a combo of cocoa butter and coconut oil and melted chocolate chips instead of using a baking bar and something about that combination made it very chewy and fudgy.

It formed the perfect crust and seems to be a good combination of gooey/fudgy to appease any discerning chocolate brownie lovers tastes. I really appreciated your taking the time to respond to my Instagram tag and advice at how to manage the intensity of the chocolate flavour given the specific ingredients that I used. I am going to try this recipe again cutting down the raw cocoa powder I used to half the quantity, replacing it with plain flour. I look forward to experimenting further, but am very pleased with my first immediate results and simplicity of this recipe :-).",

Also, I am experimenting with adding other natural sweeteners, such as - thoroughly processed Medjool dates(or other dates), apricots, cherries, and other dried, reconstituted fruits made into paste in a processor and, once-in-a-while, maple syrup(but, very little).  It'll be fun experimenting with these types of substitutions!~Carol"

				"This dish was simple to make. I love roasted cauliflower! First time trying roasting the leaves but they were quite tough even after roasting, maybe that was just my cauliflower. I subbed pine nuts which worked really well and didn't have linguine so used spaghetti. It was tasty and filling and I'll definitely be using roasted leeks in more pasta dishes.",

				"There isn't really anything more that I can add to what's already been said about your culinary genius, so rather than highlight all the many brilliances of this dish I just want to talk singularly about the inspired use of cauliflower leaves. I have literally never seen or read a recipe before that uses these inner leaves; searching the internet now there are a few mentions here and there but it's certainly not commonplace in any sense. Pulling the tray out of the oven earlier today to find these heavily toasted, caramelised leaves exuding this nutty, hoppy, slightly weedy smell was an absolute delight. To then realise that their place in the dish also involved them being a textural and flavoural bridge between the softer caramelised leeks and the harder caramelised cauliflower really just blew my mind. Absolute brilliance.",

						"3. When the mixture has mostly stuck together, turn the mixture out on to a work surface.",
						"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. Reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 5 minutes, then work the coconut oil into the dough. To begin with the dough will be slippery and it will tear easily, it will look like it\u2019s been ruined. Keep working it and eventually all the fat will get absorbed by the dough and it will become elastic and smooth (it takes about 10 minutes).",
						"5. Put the dough in a large clean bowl, coat it in a thin layer of oil and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside, in a warm (but not too warm) place until the dough doubles in size (2 hrs or more). Proceed to make the filling and the cream.",
						"6. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 8 identical portions.",
						"7. Form each portion of dough into a ball, making sure the seam is at the bottom. Place on a baking tray, cover with a kitchen towel and set aside for another 45-60 minutes for the buns to proof for the second time.",
						"8. Towards the end of the proofing time, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F (no fan).",
						"9. Bake the buns for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the tray from the oven and cover the pans with a damp kitchen towel to prevent the hard crust from forming. Allow them to cool completely.",
						"10. Once cool, cut off 1/3 of each bun and set aside. Scoop a bit of crumb out to make some room for the almond filling. The scooped out crumb can be incorporated into the marzipan filling, but I\u2019ve decided against doing that."

I am not a big fan of alcohol in baked goods myself, but it shows you can mix them up however you like as long as you keep the bun and (vegan) cream. That intrigues me; I wonder what my ideal semla would look like...perhaps a gf bun made from sorghum flour, some oat flour and soaked, pur\u00e9ed buckwheat kernels, and filled with a silky hazelnut chocolate nut butter and chopped almonds, topped with vanilla scented vegan cream... \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0b",

						"1. Rinse dried shiitake and cover with boiling water (weigh the shiitake down or else they will float) to soften. Keep immersed in water for as long as possible. I tend to use rehydrated mushrooms leftover from a mushroom stock.",

Cut off stems from rehydrated shiitake and discard them, slice the caps and add to the food processor together with all the remaining ingredients \u2013 if baking your meatballs use only 15 g / \u00bc cup breadcrumbs. I recommend not adding chickpeas yet and processing them separately to retain a bit of texture (but that\u2019s optional).",

						"10. BAKING: Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Brush a little bit of oil under each meatball and brush the tops with a little oil also. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them once halfway through. Use a flat spatula to gently prise them off the tray if they stick."

				"We have made them twice and first of all, in our house they do not keep 3-4 days.. They disappear within a few hours! :DI absolutely love this recipe. It's so easy and they taste fantastic. We used cashew-hazelnut butter. The second time we added more Amaretto because it's a match made in marzipan heaven. Rolling in chocolate without making a huge mess was a bit of learning curve.  Next time we plan to coat them with raw chocolate and maybe reduce a little bit of the sweetener. They are so rich in taste that although the recipe already doesn't have a lot of maple syrup, for my taste it can easily have even less. That could of course be due to the extra alcohol that we added. Thank you, Ania, for the inspiration and a perfectly tuned out recipe!",
				"Wow I just made these! Super easy to make, and really delicious! The quantities made exactly 18 as you said! Thank you so much for this treat, which is both vegan and luxurious! Will definitely save the recipe :)",

I admit I made a few changes since I rarely follow any recipe exactly and moreover I did not have any miso or hazelnuts and I realised I had no garlic either. I ended up making something that is cross between this recipe and your earlier recipe Vegan Balsamic Mushroom Pasta. I swapped toasted chopped cashews for the hazelnuts and added some sliced spring onions lightly fried in a little onion instead of garlic and some cayenne pepper to make it spicier. Thanks a lot  for the recipe.",

				"Delicious and so easy to make. Will have to make a double batch next time as they went so fast .  2 hungry boys at home who aren\u2019t vegan but they loved them just as much! Good for marathon training nutrition too",
				"I made these with all-purpose flour, extra pb to sub for oil, no almond milk, maple syrup  to sweeten and a load of chocolate chips blended into the dough. The cookies turned out fluffy, rich and absolutely scrumptious. This is a seriously fantastic peanut butter cookie recipe you must try!",
				"Any idea what I can use instead of almond flour as I have an intolerance to almonds?   Many thanks",
				"Your recipes are always good, but this one was amazing! I used almond butter (ran out of PB) and added vegan chocolate chips. Thank you!",
				"Hi Sapphire, You can always try using  a sugar substitute . Maybe Monk Fruit or a Stevia based  substitute.  I  tend to use a brand called Natvia,  in particular  a brown sugar style product that  up to now has been fantastic  for baking with a caramel  taste without that stevia aftertaste. I have just made a batch of these cookies using it and am waiting a bit to cook em. The batter tastes great though.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0b",
				"Hi! These look amazing, but is it possible to make them with wheat flour as opposed to gluten free? Thank you!",
				"These were the perfect thing to bake on a cosy Sunday afternoon! Really pleased with how they came out - the saltiness is just right. I took the maple syrup route and they needed a few more minutes in the oven as suggested. Thanks Ania, lockdown is a whole lot tastier thanks to your blog!",
				"These look delicious, can't wait to make them! My sister and I are sugar-free, though, and I've been altering a lot of your recipes (exchanging sugar for applesauce) but haven't been brave enough to try cookies yet. Do you think that if I exchanged the sugar for applesauce and then cut down the amount of milk, these cookies would work? Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Yummy. Cannot wait to make these. Do you think it would work so substitute the rice flour with oat flour, or extra almond flour, as I have everything but the rice flour. Thanks so much for your fabulous recipes."

				"This pad thai was absolutely gorgeous. I chopped the vegetables and made the sauce the night before, with almond butter and 4 tbsp maple sauce.  The dish came together surprisingly quickly and then got eaten really quickly as well!",
				"The pad Thai sauce was AMAZING! Using dates and the Unami ingredients was inspired. This recipe puts my cooking to another level! It\u2019s pays to follow the recipe properly and not cut corners. Take your time and you will be rewarded. I\u2019ve be asked to cook this again and again!",
				"This was an absolute treat for a rainy Tuesday evening meal! Very quick to make whilst still tasting incredible is a win for me. I doubled the mixture and the veggies (to get more for tomorrow\u2019s lunch) and found the sauce itself to be the standout of the meal. It\u2019s so creamy, peanuty & is thick (I prefer it to be a little thicker so used less water) and found adding the nori sheet and fresh ginger to the sauce really made the the meal stand out for me. I added some extra veggies (like baby corn/mangeutout) and used a pea protein \u201cchicken\u201d  as didn\u2019t have tofu to hand but I\u2019d imagine the tofu would be so delicious with this! Topped with some chillies and a warm blanket this was the perfect healthy (but tasting naughty) midweek treat!",
				"Tasty! Makes way more than 1 cup of sauce, though, so I was glad I had doubled the vegetables and added mushrooms in lieu of tofu. Next time, I'll dial back to 3 oz. dates, 1 Tbsp of tamarind paste and 5-6 thai chiles for the sauce and triple the vegetables. Thanks for a great vegan alternative!"

				"Can I use frozen gnocchi like the ones from Traders Joe?",

				"Hi Anna! Is it possible to make some of this in advance? And then do the last 15mins + 20/25mins in the oven when you are going to serve it. Looks amazing and want to make it for friends, but not really be in the kitchen anymore when they are here.",

				"This was absolutely amazing, definitely at the top of my list for comfort/cold weather food now! Made with frozen gnocchi without needing extra cooking time. Keeping this bechamel sauce in mind for other things too.",
				"delish!   soaked dried shiitake mushrooms instead of fresh; added twice as much thyme for more flavor and three times the broccoli for better health.  thanks for sharing via FB.",
				"Hey Emma, I've made the recipe with the vegan applewood cheese so the calories might be slightly different and I added 10 more grams of flour to thicken up my sauce-but it shouldn't make much difference. The whole recipe is 1400kcl, if you have 4 servings out of it, one serving is roughly 350kcl. Hope that helps!",
				"I made this yesterday just for myself and almost ate the entire dish in one go! (Granted, my package of gnocchi was smaller than 500g) I added sage and a splash of white wine to the mushrooms, and I used grated vegan cheese (which didn't really melt, but it still tasted good), and my, what a creamy, umami, comforting meal! Dzi\u0119kuj\u0119 za przepis Ania, like all the others I've tried from your blog it was delicious!Verena (the Polish learner who asked you for more Polish content, if you remember!)",

I thoroughly enjoyed making it and even more so eating it.I didn\u2019t have everything so substituted broccoli for sliced Brussels sprouts and used sage instead of thyme.It was delicious and loved by the family.Thank you!",

My only tweak was adding some water to the bechamel as it cooked - mine got thick! We used Vegan Chao for the grated cheese and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again!",

Crisp and moist, super tasty :-)I did not have courgette so used a quite dry apple, and added a bit of aquafaba to make up for the lost moisture.I had already cooked the chickpeas, so followed your guidance on adjusting the quantity and they turned out great.Thank you ! x",

So I subbed apples for courgette, defrosted kale for spinach, fennel leaves for coriander, added a dash of Chinese 5 spice and it turned  out so delicious... and *moist* on the inside.

				"Does this reheat well?Was hoping to prep the day before and reheat to serve X",
				"Hi Ania, how much jackfruit did you use? Guess 565g is not the drained weight? My boyfriend is going to prepare this on Sunday, I can't wait to taste this!",
				"What an explosion of flavours! This was beyond delicious. Thank you!",
				"Couldn\u2019t find preserved lemons in my town but everything else is scrumptious. Very rich flavours with some spice :)",
				"I absolutely love this recipe. I struggle to find good veggie tagine recipes but this is so delicious and rich. Thank you!",
				"I made this about 6 months ago and all my roommates were amazed by the amount of flavour that was packed in this dish! I am planning to make it tonight as a side dish for a full platter of dishes, do you have any recommendations on what to combine this with? I was thinking of hummus and perhaps a salad, any recommendations regarding different flavours that go well together, will be super helpful!",
				"This was spectacularly good! Gutted that I forgot about the pomegranate, they we\u2019re sitting on the counter and everything. Ah well, next time. And there will be a next time. I mean, seriously, mind blowing!!",
				"We made this for dinner last night and it was the best thing that I've eaten in ages. So much flavour, filling, comforting and with all my favourite toppings - it's definitely going on our regular list. I love finding plant based recipes that the husband loves he's pretty good but hates most tofu, seitan and cauliflower. Turns out  he's a massive fan of jackfruit.",
				"Hi Ania, I never imagined  chickpeas and Jackfruit  could come together in such a scrumptious dish ! I was wondering about  how adding almonds and pomegranate would feel - but a couple of spoons down, all doubts disappeared and we enjoyed a lovely meal ! Thank you.",
				"Absolutely delicious! It was my first time with jackfruit and it was sooo good. The perfect combination of spices - I love it!",
				"Hello AniaI want to say how absolutely delicious the jackfruit tagine is. I can\u2019t thank you enough. It\u2019s gorgeous. I didn\u2019t leave a photo as my photography skills aren\u2019t very good lol. It will be a firm favourite with me. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself. All your hard work pays off. \ud83e\udd70 Thank you again Ps. I will try the falafel. I don\u2019t normally like them because they\u2019re dry but I\u2019ll have a go at yours. Take care Julie",
				"Hi Ania Madam,It's Looking delicious I will try this recipe\ud83c\udf73.Thanks,For sharing this recipe.",
				"Really tasty dish, thank you for the great recipe - super easy to follow and great end result!",
				"This looks delicious! Do you have the nutritional information?",
				"My mouth is literally watering from seeing this beautiful meal! I hope next week is an easier ride for you! Thanks for making exquisite things :)",
				"Hi AniaThis sounds really nice, can you clarify though, when you say 'cut off the fleshy  bits of the jackfruit ' you mean the core? Thank you",
				"I am so excited to try this! I\u2019ve never had Zhough, but I have extra cariander. Off to get the pickles lemons started so we can enjoy this tomorrow. I even have a can of jackfruit. What are the chances I could find a perfect recipe that doesn\u2019t require a trip to the store during Covid?  Amazing.I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling a bit down on yourself now. I\u2019m sure it will pass. We out here in the internet ether are always inspired by you, and your recipes have been a bright spot during these dark days.",

Blob the mixture on the prepared baking tray and compress the mixture roughly using a spatula, then to make sure the mixture is even and as thin as possible (about 0.5 cm / 0.2\u2033), place another piece of baking paper on top of the mixture and roll it out with a rolling pin.

But next time I made them, I doubled the flax seeds to 4 tbsp and used 8 tbsp of water.  This makes them slightly firmer so that you can, at least dip them into humus without them crumbling into bits.  By the way, I mill my own flaxseed, so that wasn\u2019t the problem.  I also use cumin instead of rosemary, but that\u2019s just my preference.  Regardless - they are delicious and thank you for the recipe!",

Place a bit of noodles at the bottom, then a stack of marinated vegetables and start rolling it up. Stop when you reach half way, fold the right and left corner in so that the roll looks like an open envelope. Brush a bit of cornflour mixture on the final corner and finish rolling.

				"I made these last night and they were WONDERFUL!I halved the quantities (to serve 2) and used rice wrappers, as spring roll wrappers aren't easy to find in rural France. The halved recipe made 8 rice-wrapper spring rolls.The flavours were fantastic, and I'll definitely be making them again and again - they made a really satisfying meal with a little stir-fried vegetable rice. The mushroom/cabbage/carrot filling works brilliantly.  Thank you Ania!",
				"I just made these using Napa cabbage and a mixture of maitake (hen of the woods) and cremini mushrooms and no oil. They're really good. I'm definitely making a double batch next time and freezing. These spring rolls are my go-to recipe now. Thank you!",
				"All of your recipes are delicious!",
				"Hi Ania. Thanks for the reply. I made the baked version last night and I think they are superior. Well worth the wait in the oven. This is one of my very favourite recipes. They really remind me of Peking duck flavour. And this time I made a vietnamese nuoc cham sauce to have them with. These could be served at a dinner party for sure!",
				"I made these yesterday and they are absolutely awesome. I have been looking for a great vegan spring roll recipe as they are my true weakness. I used dried shitake and rehydrated them along with the oyster mushrooms. My daughter, who is beyond fussy and eats almost no vegetables, loved the smell of the filling cooking, which I agree smelled fantastic. I replaced the vermicelli with strips of tofu marinated in soy and oven baked, just because I'm off noodles at the mo. I was so tired after a hectic day that I ended up shallow frying them. I think they were a bit too oily so next time (tonight with the extras) I will oven bake. My daughter ate one as well and loved it which was amazing. Really great recipe Ania!",
				"Hi Ania, These look delicious! Can you link a photo or details of the wheat spring roll wrappers you use? I have only been able to find ones with milk :(Thank you!Caitlin",
				"It's looking delicious I absolutely try this recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe.\ud83d\ude0d",

				"We made this for New Years Day and my carnivore Aunt said it was delicious and she'd be delighted to have it again. It came out a little bit smaller than the pictures, but that might be because I chopped most of the mushrooms in the food processor - either way, it was still enough as part of a roast dinner for 6, and we'll definitely be making it again! Thank you!",
				"Made both the sausage roll and gravy for Christmas lunch, easy to make and delicious! Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!",
				"We cooked this giant sausage roll as the meat replacement of our Christmas dinner. We cooked it with smoked tofu and it was simply delicious. Instructions were (as always) easy to follow. Even though the gravy required a bit of work, it was worth the effort as it is so full of flavour. I cooked it with gf puff pastry, froze part of it and it turned out really well! Thank you so much for another delicious recipe!",
				"This is an absolute gem of a recipe! Delicious, beautiful, straightforward to put together, and just as big a hit with the non vegans as us. I used filo in place of puff pastry to cater for dietary stuff and that worked out beautifully too. Can\u2019t recommend highly enough! Thanks Ania!",
				"Could I make this in advance and freeze it after cooking?",
				"Thanks, I\u2019ll double wrap in foil and will let you know!",
				"Hi, Ania - any idea about the weight of the puff pastry you used in this recipe? They sell it here by the weight in very small portion pieces, I'm trying to figure out how many if those I need to use. Thank you in advance!",
				"Thank you for your advice, Ania! I used about 300 g of pastry. It was quite a struggle to roll 3 individual pieces into one large neat sheet. I shouldn't have tucked the pastry under the log into more than one layer 'cause in some places it remained raw. Luckily the top was perfect! Delicious and fairly easy to make, in comparison to Wellington. It was a hit at the birthday dinner. Thank you for another awesome recipe!",
				"Made this yesterday for Halloween (possibly a rehearsal for Xmas) and all I can say is Yum! The gravy was also absolutely delicious. The best praise came from my carnivorous partner who simply said \"More\".  May have to make two next time as think he could probably eat a whole one himself. Thanks so much.",
				"Super tasty and versatile recipe. Although it takes slightly longer to prep and cut all ingredients, it is very much worth it. Instead of using the 'meat' for a sausage roll, I've shaped it up into 'meat' balls and sausages to add to traybakes with great results. It's also super convenient for batch making and meal prepping and a family favourite!",
				"I made the roll for my solo new year\u2019s eve dinner and it was really delicious!",
				"Made this for New Years Eve and it came together in a breeze! Didn't have vegan Worcester sauce or nutritional yeast so I used red miso and black salt instead. It was delicious, light and the gravy complemented the roll perfectly!",
				"OK! I am making this! I will make the sausage roll  and the gravy today and I will assemble it tomorrow. I have a couple of omnivores to impress and I think this will do it!"

						"2. Add the solid (not melted) coconut oil and cut it into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or two knives. You can also use a food processor if you wish.",
						"3. Once no large lumps remain, use your fingers to rub coconut oil into the flour until it looks like breadcrumbs and there are no lumps of coconut oil left. To check for lumps, shake the bowl and they will come to the surface.",
						"4. If you are using maple syrup, mix it in with 1 tbsp of water and add it at this stage. If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 2 tbsp / 30 ml, but you may need a little more. Mix the water into the flour with a knife and then check with your hand that no more water is needed \u2013 the dough should clump together easily but should not feel wet. If it\u2019s too dry, add a tiny amount (one tsp at a time) more water, mix and check again.",
						"5. Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it up in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
						"6. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",
						"7. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.",
						"8. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.",

						"6. Bake the tart for about 45 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

				"First time making frangipane and won't be the last! So delicious and much easier than I thought. I did use a ready-made shortcrust pastry as I was short on time, but it still came out amazing. I used aquafaba from a tin of green lentils so I could chuck them in the spaghetti I was making that evening and it worked fine - no funny taste at all.",
				"I changed it just slightly using black berries instead of cranberries, but still it is so so so delicious! I would definitely repeat it again! Thank you!",
				"Amazing! This recipe is sooooo insanely good. Do yourself a favour and make it.",
				"Hey!Could  you please please clarify step 2 for me. I have a food processor-does it mean I could just put everything together in there and make a dough?Thanks in advance xx",
				"thank you soooo much xxLast question - no way to get in Lithuania almond extract or orange blossom water, what should I do..? is it ok to skip or should I substitute with something else?Thanks xx",
				"Ha ha, you are so right :) thanks so much Ania and have a lovely Holiday. Xx I will be baking this beuty tomorrow!",
				"I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it.  I substituted blueberries for cranberries and blueberry jam for the cranberry jam.  I used caster sugar and icing sugar instead of maple syrup.  It came out of the oven looking and smelling delicious.  We had it warm with vegan vanilla ice-cream.   It will definitely be added to the favourites list.  Thank you for the recipe.",
				"This looks yummy!I am allergic to almonds.  Can I use pecans and make pecan meal instead?",
				"I have made this gluten free as I am celiac and allergic to egg and it was absolutely delicious! Your recipes are just perfect for me . What a treat. Thank you for your work.",
				"Hi Ania! :) Is it possible to substitute All purpose flour for either wholemeal/spelt or buckwheat flour? Also -I am Insulin Resistant and I will need to substitute the maple syrup/sugars for a sweetner. I will be using a hight quality erythritol. Hope that works :) Thank you x",
				"Hi, I want to try this, frangipane is a real favourite in our family. Can I use a replacement for aquafaba , please?Thanks, Val",
				"Hi! Can this be frozen or it would mess up with the filling consistency?",
				"Did you end up freezing it? I\u2019m curious, I\u2019d love to make this for Thanksgiving.",
				"I made this over Christmas and it was delicious. It'll be a Christmas staple for us I think!",
				"I just made this for our Christmas Eve dessert, and it was delicious! The cranberries create a sour pop and the frangipane was deliciously almondy. Thank you for this recipe! It is definitely a keeper, and you may have helped us start a new tradition!",
				"Hi AniaI don't have fresh cranberries either, could I use dried cranberries instead or would I need to rehydrate them? If so, approximately how long would they need? Thank you!",
				"I cooked dried cranberries with water and sugar and then roughly blended it and i worked just fine! i can't tell the proportions but use quite a lot of water as cranberries will need it to become round and tender. Before blending it, I fished out some to use as a decoration. If your mass will be to runny just cook it a bit longer but also remember that it will thicken once it cools down",
				"Can you make the frangipane ahead of time and keep it in the fridge until ready to assemble",
				"Beautiful! And not as complicated as it looks. Def going to try this!",
				"Hi, could be possible to substitute cranberries by other fruit like apples or pears? Thanks, it looks delicious but in Spain is not possible to get fresh cranberries now \u263a\ufe0f"

						"1. Mix flour (and xanthan gum if making GF pastry), salt and sugar in a large bowl. If using maple syrup add it in later.",
						"2. Add chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour with two knifes. Here is a handy guide to making shortcrust pastry that I follow.",
						"3. Once the mixture is uniform and there are no large lumps left (to check, shake the bowl lightly, they will come to the surface), rub the small bits of oil into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left. Yes, I know, it does take some time!",
						"4. Finally add in ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife to distribute the water evenly. The exact amount of water needed depends on the absorbency of your flour but start off with 15-30 ml / 1-2 tbsp and add a tiny bit more at a time, if needed \u2013 too much water makes more a tough pastry.",
						"5. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.",
						"6. Once the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.",
						"7. Just before you are ready to work on the dough, preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F.",
						"8. Remove the dough from the fridge and divide it into 4 equal sized pieces. Work on one piece at a time keeping the rest in the fridge. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Use very light pressure at first and progressively roll the dough 2 mm thick.",
						"9. I used these mini tart cases so I used 8 cm / 3.15\u2033 round cookie cutters to make the circles of dough to line the moulds with. Once I lined them with pastry, I trimmed them to size using a sharp knife. You could also make them in a standard 12-hole muffin tin. If that\u2019s what you have, use a large cookie cutter (I used my biggest 10 cm / 4\u2033 circle) to cut a neat circle out of the pastry and line the muffin hole with it.",
						"10. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the edges and making sure there is no air bubble underneath the pastry. The pastry won\u2019t quite reach the top of the muffin hole but that\u2019s okay. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",

						"3. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and allow it to bubble gently for 5-10 minutes, stirring the whole time.",

						"2. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.",
						"3. They taste best still slightly warm. Cool the pies completely before storing and keep in an air-tight container, they will keep for about 2-3 days. If you want to make these in advance, I would advise freezing raw pastry cases in their moulds and freezing the mince pie filling separately and baking them on the day \u2013 bear in mind that freezing tends to dull flavours so you may want to over season your mince pie filling a touch."

But I did try the filling recipe and it\u2019s the best filling I have ever used or made! 10 out of 10! It\u2019s so festive and fun, I love the Christmas flavors so much in this! Thanks again, for sharing such a great recipe \ud83c\udf84",

				"These are stunning. I made them today with some pastry I had already made. I made the filling last night though and it's the best I've ever had.",

Store in an airtight jar for up to 3-4 days. If you want to freeze them for later, freeze them after you coated them in cinnamon sugar but before baking. Use baking paper or freeze on a baking tray initially to make sure they don\u2019t stick together."

Spread half of the cubes on each baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes (if using stale bread, it will take less time), giving them a good stir them halfway through. You want the bread to get dry and hard rather than toasted / browned \u2013 this will happen in the next phase. Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool down.",

				"5. Heat up 45 ml / 3 tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan.",
				"6. Once the oil is warmed up, add finely diced shallots and garlic and fry on a low heat until almost translucent, stirring from time to time.",

				"10. Increase the oven temperature to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F and grab a baking dish (see Notes). Brush the dish with olive oil.",
				"11. Stir bread croutons into the mixing bowl with porcini stock making sure there are no dry pieces of bread left. Then, add in the vegetable mixture from the pan and toasted nuts, leaving a few for decoration.",
				"12. Transfer the stuffing to the greased baking dish. Make sure pieces of bread are evenly interspersed in between the mushroom mixture. Decorate the top with a few extra pecans. Cover with a piece of kitchen foil and bake for about 30 minutes.",
				"13. After 30 minutes, take the foil off and continue baking for another 20-25 minutes until the top is nicely browned and crispy and the dish remains moist but not soggy.",
				"14. Store leftovers in an air-tight container in the fridge."

				"I don't know why I never thought of using different kinds of mushrooms to add depth and flavor! It's too late for this year's stuffing, but I will definitely add more variety next year. I like to add color too so I add carrots and peas to my mushroom stuffing. Occasionally I add apples or cranberries because they go so well with the pecans. Thanks for the assist, Ania!",

						"1. Sift the flour (and xanthan gum if making GF pastry) into a large bowl.",
						"2. Add the salt and chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour with two knifes. Here is a handy guide to making shortcrust pastry that I follow.\nOnce the mixture is uniform and there are no large lumps left (to check, shake the bowl lightly, they will come to the surface), rub the small bits of oil into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left. Yes, I know, it does take some time!\nFinally add in ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife to distribute the water evenly. The exact amount of water needed depends on the absorbency of your flour but start off with 60 ml / \u00bc cup and add a tiny bit more at a time, if needed \u2013 too much water makes more a tough pastry.\nTo check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.\nOnce the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and divide it into 12 equal sized pieces. Roll each piece into a rough ball with your hands and then flatten with a rolling pin. Use very light pressure at first and progressively roll the dough 2 mm thick.\nI used these mini tart cases so I lined them with pastry and trimmed to size, but I have also been testing making these in a standard 12-hole muffin tin. If that\u2019s what you have, use a large cookie cutter (I used my biggest 10 cm / 4\u2033 circle) to cut a neat circle out of the pastry and line the muffin hole with it. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the edges and making sure there is no air bubble underneath the pastry. The pastry won\u2019t quite reach the top of the muffin hole but that\u2019s okay. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\nPierce the bottom of the pastry cases with a fork several times and chill the pastry while you heat up the oven.\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Line the pastry cases with small squares or circles of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.\nBlind bake the pastry for 10 minutes. Remove the paper and beads and bake for another 5 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before adding the filling.",

Your recipes are amazing- if you publish a  Lazy Cat Kitchen cookery book- I\u2019m buying it / them.You just can\u2019t be copied,ridiculous & needs to stop, your recipes need to be deleted from a copy- cat\u2019s file, ( I see an irony there) Love your work.Thank you for your lovely work.",

I'm not sure what's the legal basis but surely you have some rights over your creations (I'm not sure how it works with recipes but you could look at possibilities). I'm terribly sorry that this is happening to you! You are one of the 2 food blogs which I'm following and enjoying a lot (and actually translating so that my parents can enjoy your recipes too!) so I hope that the plagiarism is something that can be stopped.",

I don't tend to copy recipes but I recreate  what I find Inspiring and there's plenty of that on your page.  Sorry to hear someone is stealing from you, I think I know who it is, it seems  quite obvious now that you have pointed it out. Just know that you and and your food are  greatly appreciated! I hope she can be made to stop plagiarising soon. All the best. Looking forward to making YOUR pecan pies \ud83d\ude0b",

				"Sorry to hear that you've been having this issue, sounds very frustrating! Just want to let you know that I am a huge fan of this blog - it's always the first place I look for recipes because I've had only good experiences and I know I can trust it. I also recommend it to friends all the time, including people who aren't vegan. I'm sure lots of other people out there feel the same and really value the work that you put into running this site.",
				"I also hope this infuriating cheating stops soon. Cheats get exposed then slink away. The vast majority of the food I eat is from your blog and like Cathy said, I have also made it through covid lockdown with your fabulous recipes. And I would also buy a cookbook if you ever put one out. Good luck! - tarts look divine...wish my diet was over :-(",
				"Darling Ania I am so sorry to hear you are being stolen from, and you are right to put a stop to it.   Your blog, your recipes and your photos are so personal, and it's ridiculous that someone would claim them as their own work!!!  Cheaters never win in the long run .Your emails, Facebook and Instagram posts are the  highlight of my week  and all your lovely stories about you and Duncan make me feel like I know you personally.  Thank you for all the happiness you give to me and my family.  I plan to make these tomorrow if I can find pecans at the store (they are not common here in France).",
				"It makes me so mad that you are dealing with this! I hope you are successful in making it stop. The nerve of some people is mind boggling.Honestly, your blog and Dora's Table are my two favorite spots on the internet.  I've been making something from one or each of your pages each week ever since Covid hit, and it's been a little bright spot in this darkness.  If you ever come out with a cookbook, I'll be first in line to buy it! And these look lovely. I might  make these little crusts and fill half with the filling from the pumpkin pie recipe for a little variety! Thanks for another lovely little recipe.",
				"Ania, I'm so sorry your hard work is being misappropriated and passed off by others as their intellectual property. You are a fantastic cook and an excellent baker. Thank you for what you do to promote plant-based cooking that is delicious and beautiful. I look forward to making these over the holidays!"

				"These cookies are absolutely gorgeous. I made them with buckwheat flour as suggested in the comments and the nuttiness of the tahini, almond flour, buckwheat and walnuts married beautifully. I shared the cookies with my neighbours, both of whom loved them and requested the recipe.",
				"Can these be made with a less expensive/more basic sugar such as white sugar or brown sugar?",
				"Hi girl, Only found your blog recently and loved everything I've tried so far! Brilliant ideas + beautiful pictures  =)Question for this one - do you reckon I could replace the rice flour with some other grain (the cupboard's full of spelt, buckwheat, rye, soya etc)?Best regardsMonica xx",
				"Hello Ania, What could I use in place of aquafaba ? It\u2019s not something I usually have at hand, and would like to make these when cookie craving strikes :)Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipes with us !",
				"Hi Ania,  Let me start by saying I made these cookies twice  and hope to make them lots  more times.  The first time, I followed your instructions, exactly including the part on dividing the dough into 12 cookies.  Well, they were gigantic! And as they baked they got larger and larger, and the 10-12 minutes baking time was not even close.  I removed them from the oven at about 16 minutes, concerned that I might burn them, but they weren't even close to being done.  I ended up baking them for about half an hour and they  turned out delicious!  That was about 2 weeks ago.  Today, I tried again, using a very small ice cream scooper and got 46 cookies, baking each batch 10 minutes in a turbo oven at 170 degrees C.  They are perfect!!!  Thank you for a terrific recipe.",
				"Ania, these cookies are to die for!! My absolutely new number one (the second are amaretti <3) I used peanut batter and they are just great!",
				"I've made these twice already and love them! I don't usually enjoy walnuts in cookies but these really bring out the flavor and it is super delicious together! I like to freeze these and eat one when I need a sweet treat, they're great frozen and not too hard. With the scooper I use, I get about 2 dozen out of these cookies so that's a bonus too! Thanks so much! <3",
				"These were so outstanding, perfect chewiness and sweetness. We made the all tahini version and it wasn't too strong, just right. And feeling so proud of my fellow Pennsylvanians for sealing the deal with the election! Also thank you for a recipe that doesn't make three dozen cookies. I would have eaten them all!",
				"Ohhh these look SO delicious. What a lovely idea to use tahini:)",
				"These look perfect to settle my election week jitters. Tahini in sweets is my absolute favorite!",
				"Anita, you are a hard worker to have undertaken all those diy projects! I look forward to your enjoying the fruits of your labor. \ud83d\ude0b. Thanks for the recipe; cookies look delicious."

Remember to give the sauce a good stir from time to time to ensure that the middle of the pan does not burn.",

I want to make a birthday cake for my brother and was wondering this recipe would translate into a 9\" cake tin? Any tips if I need to change quantities etc? thank you!",
				"These muffins are amazing! So moist and fluffy, they turned out perfectly! Worth waiting for your bananas to go really brown just so you can make these! Thanks for the recipe.",
				"OMG my fav \ud83d\udc95",
				"I left out the chocolate but put frosting on top - the kids loved them.  I made them gluten free - but they had a really nice texture.  Thanks for a great recipe.",
				"Yum! I didn't quite cook them for the allotted time so they turned into vegan chocolate banana bread brownie muffins! My mum, sister and I loved them and I shall be making them again :) Thanks for the awesome recipe.",
				"My dad made these for me while I was busy doing uni work the other week and they were amazing! They rise a lot so one muffin satisfies you, & they\u2019re so lovely, rich, moist & chocolately\ud83d\ude0d",
				"These are so good! I made them tonight, used avocado oil as that\u2019s all I had, and they turned out fantastically. I also used whole wheat pastry flour and it worked great. Thanks for such a delicious recipe :)",
				"Oh my! These are delicious, soft and chocolaty!  Thank you for another fantastic recipe.",
				"The best ever! My non-vegan son is opening a coffee shop soon and I am on the lookout for items he can have made - these definitely make the cut! Everyone who has tasted them loves them.  So easy to make... and they thaw out well after freezing. Will be making them again very soon... waiting for my bananas to get ripe enough :).",
				"These are fabulous! I made them today and they may not last until tomorrow around here...Really a cupcake but don't tell anyone : )",
				"They look amazing! Do you think it would work with soy yogurt instead of nut butter?  And does it have to be a mixed gf  flour? (I can\u2019t tolerate rice or wheat)",
				"Can you  freeze these muffins?",
				"Hope you enjoy your time in London and that your business is smoothly accomplished. Also that Duncan\u2019s tinnitus is improved. Best wishes, sally."

						"1. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F  and grab an old-fashioned (ideally steel, not teflon-coated) baking tray.",
						"2. Cut your aubergines / eggplants into 1.25 cm / \u00bd\u201d rounds and arrange them on the baking tray. There is no need to grease them. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, flipping the slices to the other side halfway through. They are done when soft all the way though and lightly browned on both sides.",
						"3. Put chickpeas in a food processor and process until coarsely ground. Be careful not to overprocess as you do want your meatballs to have a bit of texture and that is why I recommend grinding chickpeas separately from the rest of the ingredients. Transfer the chickpeas out of the food processor and set aside.",
						"4. Place baked eggplants and all the remaining meatballs ingredients, apart from the breadcrumbs and oil, in the food processor and process until smooth. I recommend grating the garlic and onion beforehand as you want their flavour evenly distributed throughout the meatball mixture.",
						"5. Transfer the mixture into a large mixing bowl, add ground chickpeas and mix well. Add enough breadcrumbs to absorb excess moisture and to give the meatballs better texture. If you intend to bake your meatballs rather than fry them you can leave the mixture a little bit wetter as the oven will dry the meatballs out a little. Chill for 1-2 hours in the fridge before forming the meatballs.",
						"6. Once chilled, form the mixture into same size meatballs (mine were 21 g / \u00be oz each). You can either bake them or fry them.",
						"7. To bake, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Brush a little bit of oil under each meatball and brush the tops with a little oil also. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them once halfway through. They are likely to stick to the tray so use a flat spatula to gently prise them off first.",
						"8. To fry, preheat a heavy skillet or pan, cover the bottom of the skillet with oil (about 2 tbsp). Allow the oil to heat up and then arrange the meatballs (it\u2019s important not to overcrowd the pan so you may need to do it in 2 batches) on the skillet in a clockwise order. Give them a little bit of time to seal and then turn them gently, keep on turning until they are cooked all over, arrange on a clean paper towel to absorb the excess oil.",

Also forgot to buy pomegranate molasses so I just left it out. But it still was very delicious! Will definitely make again and I will adhere to the recipe better so that they will turn out perfect! Can't wait. Definitely loved the flavour combinations, such a unique and creative dish! Thank you :)",

My boyfriend said I didn\u2019t stop saying how amazing the dinner was while I was eating; not even realizing it!I did throw in two leftover grilled beyond  sausages into the eggplant mixture while making the meatballs.  Made both your sauces - subbed some berry basaltic glaze for the pomegranate molasses. : served with some homemade spicy tapenade and tablule. The meatballs wrapped in the pita bread topped with the sides was an absolute delight and very filling. Look forward to the leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!"

Toast for about 8 minutes, until golden and fragrant. Be aware that this second method works better for a larger quantity (2-3 cups) of nuts. Allow them to cool and chop roughly.",
				"2. Increase the oven temperature to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F. Coat clean grapes in 1 tsp of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and place on a small baking tray. Roast for about 15-20 minutes, until the grapes become soft and get juicy.",
				"3. Slice fennel on the smallest mandolin setting or slice it thinly by hand, using a sharp knife. Place sliced fennel in a bowl of ice-cold water with 2 tsp of lemon juice to prevent oxidisation. Set aside for 10-15 minutes, fennel will become crispier and nicer to eat.",
				"4. Mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl. If using walnut / cashew butter instead of oil, add approximately 1 tbsp of water to thin the dressing out a little. Once the grapes come out of the oven, add the grape juice that gathers at the bottom of the baking tray into the dressing to balance it out with some natural sweetness.",
				"5. Drain sliced fennel well. Place it in a mixing bowl with your choice of greens and stir through half of the dressing.",

This is going in my recipe file, will be making them on a regular basis. Thank you!!!!",

My bf and I just love your bibimbap recipe SO much, so thanks for that too!After taking waaay too many aspirin and damaged my auditory nerve cells apparently, I have lived with tinnitus for many years. tt now seems it's just become part of my life and thankfully I'm able to mostly ignore it. Sometimes I try and turn it around to think a herd of crickets chirping me me feel like summer is still here. But seriously, I understand how disturbing it can be, because I've been there. Hoping Duncan has gotten some answers and that it starts ramping down soon.",

The plantain seeds added a musty nutty taste to them and I am going to make some more to jolly up my teenage daughter who is not so lively just now. Long live vegans!!! Thankyou so much and may you have a cosy evening too! XXX",
				"They are in the oven now and I am looking forward to trying them very much! I used some weeds in lieu of the flaxseed which I collected at the end of the summer...autumn time. The plant has a lot of seeds and i can't remember for the life of me what it is called!! Derr! But.... we shall see if it works! I too have tinnitus as of about 5 years and am deaf in my right ear and awaiting an appt at the hospital. It is so annoying but I do wonder if it is caused by all the wifi and 5g and who knows what else..... it has just crept up on me and so let us hope for duncan that he will find a way. Good luck! :)",
				"Could you freeze these?",
				"love this, i gave some to my friends, after they tasted it they're asking for the recipe, ty very much, I run out of almonds so I use walnuts instead, still yummy, not so sweet",

				"it looks really nice, how to make it also easy with a very clear method supported by notes.I'll make it at home soon, thanks for sharing :)",
				"Made this recipe today and loving it - love that it\u2019s low sugar and oil free but still SUPER tasty!!! Thanks for another great recipe!",
				"These are absolutely stunning and so easy to make. I didn't have whole almonds so used sliced ones and they were perfect. Whole family loves them.",
				"UK readers - make sure that the orange is vegan. Most oranges (and clementines, satsumas, etc.) from supermarkets and greengrocers aren't vegan because they are coated with beeswax or shellac - look for E901 or E904 in tiny print on the label. If you want unwaxed oranges, you will probably need to buy the organic ones.",
				"Recipe email came through at 6.28pm. First batch eaten by 9.28pm. They are delicious! Thank you for the recipe. You never fail me. These will be part of Christmas celebrations too. The orangey tang is just right with the almond. You keep \u2018em comin\u2019 and I\u2019ll keep on makin\u2019 \u2018em (and the bearded one here says he\u2019ll keep on eatin\u2019 \u2018em) lol.",
				"This may be completely out of left field, and feel free to dismiss! But I have heard that tinnitus could be  the first stage of channeling higher guidance ...wisdom trying to come through.  I can't imagine how frustrating it is, but maybe this is another avenue to explore in meditation? Thank you for your  recipes, always enjoy trying them!",
				"So sorry to hear about the tinnitus! My sister went through a bout a few years ago and she told me that she worked on telling herself that she was simply hearing the song of the universe. It helped her in way that made it a bit less overwhelming. Wishing Duncan wellness. My sister's is not an issue anymore! AND I am excited to try the cookies!"

				"Holy moley this was AMAZING. I put the eggplant into the oven in small pieces like the other reviews suggested and doubled the amount of gochujang. Such an easy weekday lunch that came together in 20 minutes. I'll be making this over and over and over again. Thank you!!",

				"I made this for dinner yesterday and it was a nice and easy weeknight option. I love Asian food, specifically Korean and Japanese cuisine so the flavours for this was a treat! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I love this recipe!  I have made it a bunch of times.  I'm not the biggest fan of eggplant, but the flavor of this is strong and the baking process for the eggplant takes care of the texture issues for me.  I have also made this with cubed tofu in place of eggplant.  It is good with or without the coriander.  I have doubled the sauce before and tossed it with a lot of steamed broccoli to bulk it up with veg.  It's very fast and easy.",

I\u2019ve made this about 3 or 4 times now, as a main and as a side dish to sweet potato curry and it always turns out well.",
				"This was absolutely delicious. Beautiful ingredients, and stunning flavours!!!Served it with choy sum and brown rice. Beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!",
				"This might be the best meal i have ever made myself! I will eat this every week for the rest of my life. It really is just perfect. The sauce is great and EXACTLY the right amount. Spot on!",
				"\"Spot on!\" My other half commented. This is a really quick and easy meal to make. Packed full of flavour too. We chopped the aubergines into chunks first which cut down on cooking time. I'm always skeptical with recipes that include maple syrup as they can be so sweet, but the proportions of the ingredients in sauce worked extremely well. Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Yummie this was so good. I made these delicious eggplants this evening and I couldn't stop eating. So good and so easy to make. The only thing I changed up I made was that I already cut up the eggplant in smaller pieces before I put them in the oven.Every now and then we have an eggplant-week: I cook every night a meal with eggplant, but every evening something else. Next time these gochuang eggplants are in!thanks you for your lovely recipes, Ania!",

All the teady pastes are terrible in ingredients and the traditional recipe is way too complicated. It would be great to have a recipe with no soy , no corn or nasty sweeteners.  Kasia",
				"I love eggplant and have been craving it. Baba ghanoush was going to make an appearance until I saw this recipe. It was perfect! Baking the eggplant worked so well and was hands off. I hate ordering eggplant out as it's always soaked with oil and mushy. Smitha asked for a date night recommendation and I think soup  would be a great starter. Your miso pumpkin soup would be great and also seasonal.",

The tricky part here is that it is only possible to judge the reduction once the mixture has cooled down completely so it\u2019s easy to over reduce or not reduce enough. That\u2019s not a problem though \u2013 if you over reduced, bring it back with a small splash of water. If not reduced enough, return the pot to the stove and simmer some more."

				"This is such a great dish!!!! My friend, who is not so big on being plant based, remarked after, \"I think I should try going eating plants instead of meat for like 30 days!\" If that isn't a sign that this recipe is AMAZING, I don't know what is!",
				"The colour looks very attractive! I like beetroots not only its colour but also its health benefit. It decides us nutrition, vitamin C and B9. Additional the little bit fat of walnut makes this recipe quite healthy. I like to sprinkle more basil.",
				"This recipe came to me in the exact, perfect time, which is time for the homegrown beetroot. I baked the cauliflower, as recommended in the recipe, and mixed it with homemade walnut butter (so potent there was no need for additional oil). And of course added all the rest. The outcome is just divine! So yummy, and so filling, love it! Silky cauliflower paste with the texture of beetroot, and crunchiness of the freshly roasted walnuts...purrrrfect!",
				"Would this be good at room temperature, like for a picnic? ThanksPs I adore skordalia made with almonds",

Alternatively, you can roast them in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven but be aware that this works better for larger quantities or else they burn rather quickly. I tend to roast at least 2 cups of seeds at a time for about 8-10 minutes. Allow them to cool down completely before blending in the pesto.",

I used 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup of lemon juice in my pesto, as I like a bit of lemon flavour but please adjust the amount to your taste. Once everything is minced well, start adding olive oil. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste (I used approximately 1 tsp in total).",

				"Stupidly delicious as always; I'm in particular awe of how you give such simple ingredients a particular depth in a way that bypasses usual flavour templates and connects to the earth itself. That might sound absurdly metaphysical but I choose to believe that someone's appreciation and devotion can translate in such a way. In any case, since discovering your blog a few years ago my family's weekly cooking routine has gradually grown to use those that you've shared predominantly, simply because they're the best options available. If you were ever to release a physical book of recipes for easy reference I'd be beyond keen to get multiple copies to send to friends and family, particularly those that chase me up months after the fact for \"that pasta I made one time\".Thankful for your genius,Arthur",
				"I used a similar recipe to yours the other day which used Hemp Seeds instead of Pine Nuts and it was delicious and am sure more nutritious.  I shall try your recipe out next using Pumpkin Seeds as I\u2019m sure that will work great too."

						"2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes and then set aside for 30-60 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take one quarter of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one (I don\u2019t).",
						"4. Place one pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface, use a glass or a cookie cutter (I used 7 cm / 2.75\u2033 diameter one) to cut out circles. Make small blobs (\u00bd tsp as it\u2019s important not to overfill) of filling in the middle of each circle. Fold each circle in half around the filling ensuring there are no air pockets in the dumpling or else it will burst during cooking.",
						"5. Put the finished ravioli on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you have used up all the dough and / or all the filling.",
						"6. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water boils, place a few ravioli (do not overcrowd the pot) in the boiling water and cook, on a rolling boil, for about 5 minutes. After the time is up, fish cooked ravioli out with a slotted spoon, shaking excess water off gently, and place them on a plate. Cook all the remaining ravioli in this way.",

Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water.

						"2. Bring the lentils to a simmer. Simmer, on a low heat, for about 20-25 minutes \u2013 keep an eye on the lentils towards the end of the cooking time to make sure they do not overcook. Test one to be sure they are done to your liking, drain and set aside to cool.",

Grill for a few minutes on each side until nicely charred, take off the heat and place on a plate covering with a big, upside down, bowl \u2013 it will make skin removal easier. If you don\u2019t have a griddle pan you can roast your peppers under an oven grill instead.",

						"6. Combine cooled lentils, with finely diced onion, most of the parsley and thyme \u2013 leave some for decoration. Dress with some of the prepared dressing, adjust seasoning to taste.

						"1. Place the lemon juice, garlic, plant milk, a good pinch of salt and rinsed almonds in an blender (Ninja blender works well here).",
						"2. Blend until smooth, using a spatula to return the mixture that stays on the walls of your blender back to the centre. The mixture will eventually get really thick and the blender will struggle. I have a little trick to combat this, but please be very careful as it requires you to have the lid off while the blender is running. I slide my spatula flat against the wall of the blender and ever so slightly push the mixture into the centre, which sort of feeds it back into the blades again and prevents an air bubble from forming underneath the surface. I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.",
						"3. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.",
						"4. Prepare / activate agar in 3 tbsp of water, according to the instructions on the packet. Add the resulting gel to the \u2018cheese\u2019 mixture quickly and blend until smooth. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have agar agar, allow the mixture to drain and then bake it as in this recipe.",

						"1. Place cornflour and salt in a large mixing bowl.",
						"2. Add 360 ml / 1\u00bd cups of water and mix well, with a spoon first and then with your hands. Knead for a bit to distribute the moisture evenly, then gather everything into a ball and allow it to rest for 15 minutes under a damp kitchen towel. After the resting time, the dough should be supple and soft, not dry, but not sticky either. If the dough feels too dry, add a tiny bit more water and a bit more flour if too sticky.",
						"3. Divide the dough into 10-14 (depending on how big you want your tortillas) even portions and roll each into a ball. Using scales is the best way to do this, of course.",
						"4. Place the balls in a bowl underneath a damp kitchen towel."
					]
				},
				{
					"PRESSING": [
						"1. To press the dough balls, you will need a piece of foil or greaseproof paper. The best thing to use is a large zipper bag with the zip and bottom cut off and one of the sides split open. You can clean, dry and reuse this bag many times to minimise waste. Otherwise a piece of greaseproof paper also works, not as well as it tends to absorb some of the moisture out of the tortillas and its surface gets a bit crumpled in the process, but it does work. The size of this lining material depends on the size of your press \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to get caught in the hinges, but equally, you don\u2019t want it too small as the dough will spill out \u2013 I use a piece that when folded in the middle gives me a 19 cm / 7.5\u2033 square.",
						"2. TORTILLA PRESS\nLine the tortilla press with your plastic or paper lining, place a dough ball a little off centre \u2013 closer to the main hinge than to the handle, put the second layer of your lining material down, close the press and the gently press down. You may want to rotate the tortilla 180 degrees, to ensure that it is evenly pressed as usually the part close to the handle gets a little flatter.",
						"3. NO TORTILLA PRESS\nPlace a dough ball in the middle of the two layers of foil or paper and gently squash it with a heavy skillet or pan. Then use a rolling pin, through the lining material, to gently roll it out thinner if needed. Apply very delicate, even pressure with the rolling pin for best results."
					]
				},
				{
					"COOKING": [
						"1. Have your tortilla warmer handy or prepare a contraption for keeping your tortillas warm and supple. A clean kitchen towel to wrap cooked tortillas in and something to lock the warmth in is what\u2019s needed \u2013 a small insulated cool bag, a dutch oven with a lid lined with bubble wrap etc., get creative.",
						"2. Heat up a comal or a heavy cast iron pan / skillet on a medium-high heat for about 3-4 minutes.",
						"3. Once the pan is hot, grab the first tortilla together with the lining foil / paper. Peel one layer of the lining foil off and place the tortilla flat in the palm of your hand, then peel the other side of the lining material off very slowly and gently.",
						"4. Lower your tortilla holding hand into the pan, flip your hand and allow the tortilla to fall flat onto the pan\u2019s surface.",
						"5. Leave the tortilla undisturbed for about 60 seconds so that the bottom side gets sealed \u2013 do that even if your tortilla doesn\u2019t quite land flat, it will be easier to take it off the pan cleanly.",
						"6. While your first tortilla is cooking, press another one and have it ready to place in the pan as soon as the first one is done.",
						"7. After 60 seconds, slide a spatula underneath the tortilla and flip it. Press it down with the spatula for a few seconds, at this point you may or may not have bubbles forming underneath the surface. Don\u2019t panic if they don\u2019t form, they don\u2019t always. Cook for 30-60 seconds. Then flip again and cook for another 30-60 seconds. As a rule of thumb, cook each tortilla for 2-3 minutes in total and while it\u2019s tempting to get it nicely charred, don\u2019t push it too much as your tortillas will end up dry and brittle.",
						"8. Once off the pan, place the cooked tortillas in a tortilla warmer (or your homemade equivalent). They will soften from the steam and remain warm and supple.",
						"9. Consume straight away, or store, wrapped tightly, for one 1-2 days. You can also freeze them separated by squares of baking paper and locked away in a freezer bag or an airtight container. Reheat in a steamer once thawed."

				"Hi Ania - really looking forward to cooking this for my vegan GF daughter in law. A quick question- how long is too long to marinate the veg? I\u2019m off to work, so can they sit (in a zip lock bag in fridge) for 8 hours or will that turn the veg?Cheers and will give you an update after I serve it.",
				"Really, really good and ridiculously easy! Really tasty marinade that turns to a nice sauce. Thank you!",
				"I had some Portobello mushrooms on hand and a husband who was craving salsa. So I made this and switched the shrooms for the ones I had and my husband is now sitting at the table rubbing his belly and asking when can we have this again! Thank you Ania!",
				"I had my first ever all vegan, organic dinner party tonight for some friends who are strict vegan and used this recipe. Wow! I made a couple of changes and used chipotle Chile powder, portobello and ah\u00edtale mushroom (only because I found your recipe after I grocery shopped). I was skeptical about it turning out tasting grilled but it did! Love the marinade. May need to use this on other recipes. Thank you!",
				"We made these fajita vegetables as part of a selection of filling for tacos. They were easy to make (I always appreciate being able to stick something in the oven) and full of flavour. The thickness of the sliced vegetables really makes a difference- some of our peppers were more thinly sliced, and while the flavour was good, the texture wasn't as satisfying as the larger pieces. These will definitely be included as regulars for future tacos.",
				"This is one of my favourites, so tasty and I\u2019m not vegan.Have shared this with family and friends and we all love it.",
				"Hello, I\u2019m planning on making these for a friend this week\u2026please can you tell me what you would recommend adding to the fresh tomato salsa ? - it look lovely in your photo! Thanks :)",

				"Will probably cook the veggies on stove top next time to better judge how they are progressing but I love the flavour!! Definitely going to make again :-)",
				"Absolutely fantastic! Thank you for this recipe!! Likely the best fajita marinade/sauce I've ever had - although it was a touch acidic to me, so I added a touch more maple syrup. I ended up with too many veggies and not enough meatiness from the mushrooms. Next time I'll double the mushrooms and include shiitakes as well. 5 * out of 5!!!",
				"This has become one of my go-to mid week suppers. It\u2019s super tasty and easy to make. Thank you Ania - your blog has really become one of my most relied upon resources.",
				"Just made these this afternoon with my non-vegan friends. Used less oil and made it in a pan. But they were incredibly delicious! And so easy too! Also and easy way to get in some veggies :)",
				"This is an excellent recipe and tastes so much like the non-vegan alternative I am so used to from Mexico and elsewhere. Make sure to do pieces indicated size; mine were too thin first time.",
				"Such a tasty recipe with lots of different flavours and textures! Thank you for such a great recipe. Really healthy and nutritious- I don't feel bad going back for seconds or thirds ! :)",
				"This recipe is life-changing\u2019! It\u2019s not just delicious in itself but I\u2019ve realised that this marinade works with most vegetables. My favourite being roasted cauliflower and chickpeas slathered in the mix, then roasted for about 25 mins. Then I add roasted corn and some wilted spinach.",
				"I\u2019ve made these twice now. Really good and really easy to make. I do cut down on the oil and find  they are delicious just the same. The addition of maybe some avocado and a dollop of vegan sour cream feels like I\u2018ve stepped into an authentic Mexican restaurant.  This is a staple recipe in our home now. Thank you!",

				"I love it. Vgean and delicious looking. And I really like the bake method. Much easier and healthier than frying.",
				"This was really good! I love the texture of the mushrooms. Thank you for the recipe :)",
				"Made these last night and they were fantastic - we cooked them on the grill (in a cast iron pan) because it\u2019s been too hot to turn on the oven:)  My husband and son both said this is an instant classic!  Will be part of our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing.",
				"These look so delicious, I\u2019m looking forward to making them!",

						"1. Heat up the oven to 180\u00b0 C (or 160\u00b0 C fan forced) / 355\u00b0 F (320\u00b0 F fan forced). Grease a 1 kg / 2 lb cake tin (see NOTES) and line it with a wide strip of baking paper to be able to remove your cake easily.",
						"2. Stir the yoghurt, oil (if using) and sugar together with a spatula until the mixture is uniform.",
						"3. Add in the plant milk (if using melted coconut oil, make sure the plant milk is lukewarm rather than fridge cold), vanilla extract, lemon zest and turmeric (if using). Mix well.",
						"4. Place a large sieve over the bowl with the wet ingredients and sift almond flour through. Gently mix it into the wet ingredients using a spatula.",
						"5. Next sift in flour, salt and both baking agents. Fold them into the wet ingredients gently, making small circles from the centre of the bowl gradually incorporating more dry ingredients into the wet ones \u2013 I find that this method prevents lumps from forming. The batter should have a fairly thick, rather than pourable consistency.",
						"6. Finally, stir through flour coated blueberries, leaving any excess flour behind. If using wheat flour, be mindful not to overwork the batter \u2013 stir just enough for the blueberries to get incorporated.",
						"7. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tin. While it is really tempting to stick a few extra blueberries into the surface of the cake, they will cause the cake to crack and possibly overflow so I don\u2019t recommend it. If you want to make the cake look good and are not planning to top with yoghurt as per my suggestion in step 10, a handful (not too much as you still want to have some cake surface exposed to absorb lemon syrup) of slivered or flaked almonds on top will look nice.",
						"8. Bake for about 40-45 min, until a toothpick comes out clean and the top is nicely browned.",
						"9. Once cool, soak with hot (that\u2019s important) lemon syrup \u2013 it will give the cake a lemony flavour and provide extra moistness.",
						"10. Optionally, serve with thick vegan coconut yoghurt and fresh blueberries or blueberry sauce (blueberries cooked down with a splash of water)."

				"I made this for dessert for our weekly family dinner and it wowed us all. The tanginess of the lemon made it stand out for me, so not too sweet. And the yoghurt topping continued the theme. I\u2019ll be making this again without doubt \ud83d\ude0b",
				"Hi Ania, I made half of the recipe this morning into muffins -it made 5, and I baked them for 25 minutes and left off the lemon sugar syrup, and just topped with slivered almonds...They were delish!! Moist, light, fluffy!Thank you so much for a winner, again, of a recipe!X",
				"Hi Ania, This recipe looks amazing, and I'm pretty certain it tastes as amazing as it looks, what with knowing your quality recipes!Just wondered if this could be made into a cupcake/ muffin... I did see you have a blueberry muffin recipe - but this blueb lemon combo just sounds so delish!",
				"So delicious! It's super fresh but also really indulgent, the perfect  balance. A quick and simple recipe too, so even a novice cook like myself can end up with a mouth watering cake. My partner, whom this was made for, was so so pleased. Would definitely recommend!!",
				"Hi there, would I be able to leave out the blueberries or use frozen? Would I need to make adjustments if that were the case?Thank you so much, the recipe looks great!",
				"Hi, I've made this cake but I might've added a little bit more blueberries.However, the cake turned out soggy (it was still delicious) and not nice and crumbly like the picture haha.How could I prevent this from happening? I want to try it again :)",
				"I made this cake and it was absolutely delicious!  I made a lemon juice and confectioners sugar glaze in addition to pouring the lemon and sugar syrup over the cake first and it was perfect, moist, flavorful and perfect balance of sweet and lemony.  I made it for my vegan niece but I would make it again for myself or non-vegan friends too.  So good.  Everyone loved it.",
				"Just made this !! So delicious and very happy with how it turned out :)",
				"Thank you for sharing this delightfully easy, mouthwateringly delicious recipe. Have baked this cake several times since I first tried it a few weeks back and it\u2019s been a huge success each time!",
				"Amazing!! I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect with this loaf but it is simply delicious! I did mine a little different. I used half cup almond meal and half cup coarsely ground almond - and didn\u2019t sift either. I mixed all dry ingredients together and the wet ingredients, and added the wet to the dry instead of the other way around. Turned out wonderful thankyou!!",
				"Hello mam Can I replace almond flour with wheat flour??",
				"I made  this  yesterday. It was really delicious ! (We\u2019ve never eaten so much cake before.)",
				"Looks amazing!! Can i replace the almond flour with another type of flour/starch? I don\u2019t do well with nuts or seeds."

				"1. Press your raspberries through a sieve to get rid of the seeds \u2013 you should end up with under a cup of raspberry puree. You don\u2019t have to do that but your mousse will be a bit gritty if you skip this step.",
				"2. If making the CASHEW VERSION, place pulp from the raspberries, vanilla extract, cashew butter and maple syrup (if using sugar don\u2019t add it in yet) at the bottom of a blender. If you are making the COCONUT VERSION whisk all of the ingredients (apart from sugar if that\u2019s what you choose to sweeten it with) together in a bowl using a wire whisk.",
				"3. If making the CASHEW VERSION, add drained and rinsed cashews and blend until the mixture is silky smooth. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.",
				"4. Place aquafaba in a clean (that\u2019s very important as any grease residue will prevent the aquafaba from foaming) glass or metal bowl. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice. Whip it until you achieve stiff peaks \u2013 you should be able to invert the bowl and the whipped aquafaba should not budge an inch. If it does it means that it hasn\u2019t been whipped enough.",
				"5. If USING SUGAR to sweeten, add it slowly to the whipped aquafaba whipping well after each addition.",
				"6. As I wanted to prettify this dessert for the blog, I mashed up some extra raspberries and placed a thin layer of them at the bottom of each glass, but be aware that the extra moisture makes the mousse a little less firmly set where it comes in contact with the raspberries. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of an issue, but I want you to be aware.",
				"7. Fold stiff aquafaba into the raspberry mixture gently and gradually (I do it in 3-4 batches) until the two are well incorporated. Use a slow folding motion so that you don\u2019t knock too much air out of the dessert when mixing. The mixture will deflate a little bit, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. Pour the mixture between 4 small glasses and place them in the fridge for 8 hours (or overnight) for the mousse to set.",
				"8. Once the mousse has had a chance to set, decorate with fresh raspberries just before serving. This dessert keeps in an airtight container for about 2 days."

				"This is absolutely the best recipe for vegan raspberry mousse it was a huge success, Everyone loved it! I made my own Aquafaba. It was very easy following your instructions. I never would of thought of using garbanzo beans but, it works great! I made one batch with cashews and one with coconut milk, both are good but the coconut milk version is the creamiest great texture and is my favorite!Thank you for sharing \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I made the coconut version and it was AMAAAAAAAZING. So light, fluffy and flavourful. I used strawberries that I froze last summer and these came out fruity and not too sweet. I have managed to eat 3 today, despite my best efforts at control.",
				"HII soak and cook batches of organic chickpeas as  we were using  so many cans!!  Wondering which part of the process gives me aquafaba?   The water after they've been soaked overnight?   Or the water after they've been boiled for 2-3 hours?Neither of them have the appearance or feel of aquafaba from a can... thanksCarol",
				"I blended the full fat coconut milk with the vanilla and maple syrup, and it completely separated :(",

				"Hi Ania, I\u2019ve made the cashew + maple version and it turned out amazing. So light and airy, very tasty and not too sweet. I substituted almond butter for the cashew butter. We love your recipes!",
				"What a coincidence, I made similar one using farm fresh strawberries recently, they came our really well except that when store din fridge the bottom became a bit watery!",
				"This is delicious! First batch made from homemade raspberries is currently cooling in the fridge - doubt it will last long. Felt a bit indulgent so whipped some coconut cream to top it with. Dessert will be a bit outrageous tonight!",
				"Hi Ania,This looks really yummy but do you this I could use thawed frozen raspberries or would it make it too runny?",

				"Are you using tinned aquafaba or making your own? We used to use tinned aquafaba but recently all the different brands we have tried have switched from a sugar and salt brine, to a purely salt brine. This is obviously more salty and is too salty to use in most things, even hummous. Any ideas?"

				"Gorgeous! I made it for two of us in a smallish dish so scaled it down a bit (2 big aubergine, 1 tin toms,etc) but used the whole amount of cheese sauce which was delicious. I'd make it bigger next time as we finished the lot in one go and could have eaten more :D",
				"Thanks for another aubergine recipe Ania.  The strange weather this year has given me a glut of aubergines and tomatoes .  Thanks also for the tip of baking aubergine slices with no need for salt or oil.  I learned that from you a couple of years ago in a moussaka recipe.  I have a wood-burning stove and if it's lit I bake aubergine slices and then cool them and pop them in the freezer compartment of my fridge - ready to add to any dish when needed."

				"8. Once the garlic is softened and fragrant, add in dissolved miso paste and nutritional yeast and a squeeze of lemon, and a pinch of salt \u2013 stirring everything together so that you get a light emulsion that will coat your pasta. Allow it to bubble for a few seconds, adding a touch more pasta cooking water if the sauce is too thick. I used up just over 60 ml / \u00bc cup of pasta cooking water in total.",
				"9. Add drained pasta to the sauce. Coat the pasta in the sauce, season well, including a sprinkle of fine chilli flakes (if using) and then stir cooked veggies through. If you cooked your corn on the grill, shave the kernels off the cob and add them to the pasta.",

				{
					"PASTRY": [
						"1. Mix the flour, sugar, salt and xantham gum (if using a gluten-free flour mix instead of an all purpose wheat flour) in a large bowl or a food processor. If using maple syrup instead of sugar, mix it in with water and add it at the end, be mindful of the fact that as maple syrup is a liquid ingredient, you are likely to need less water, so start off with 60 ml / \u00bc cup and add more if needed.",
						"2. Add chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour using a pastry cutter (or two knives) or pulse in a food processor until you obtain a sandy texture that clumps together when you grab a handful, with no large lumps of fat left. To check for large lumps, shake the bowl \u2013 it will bring large bits of oil to the surface.",
						"3. While you can do this step in the food processor, I strongly suggest you transfer the mixture to a large bowl at this point and do this manually as then you have a greater amount of control. Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water, incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using just short of 105 ml / 7 tbsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flour brands have different absorbency levels.",
						"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc, wrap it up in cling film and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the ricotta filling (see below).",
						"5. After the dough has had a chance to rest, cut 1/3 of it and set it aside. Gently and slowly roll 2/3 of the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.",
						"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm / 1\u2033 bigger than the tart case (I used a 25 cm / 10\u2033 diameter tart case). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the case and unroll it gently. Line the case making sure the dough fits into the case snugly, do not trim the excess just yet as it helps to have it when attaching the lattice top.",
						"7. About 30 minutes before you are ready to bake your vegan crostata, place a pizza stone (ideally, if you have one) or a well conducting metal tray in the oven and heat the oven up to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F (160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F fan forced). Placing the crostata on a hot pizza stone / well heated metal tray prevents the bottom from being soggy.",
						"8. Spread the jam evenly on the bottom of the tart case. Followed by the \u2018ricotta\u2019 mixture\u2019.",
						"9. Roll the remaining portion of the dough into another large circle and using a sharp knife or a dough cutter, cut it into long strips. Criss-cross the strips over the pie attaching them into the overhanging crust, trim the excess crust with a knife.",
						"10. Brush the pastry generously with vegan \u2018eggwash\u2019.",
						"11. Place crostata in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheesecake is set. Allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting although I find that it cuts much neater when cooled completely.",
						"12. Optionally, you may want to dust the cooled tart with a little icing sugar."

I have a sour cherry tree in my garden that covers itself in fruit in late spring and so I'm always looking for new recipes as well as inviting Polish friends round to harvest as many as they can use\ud83d\ude0a.  The fruit makes jams and jellies with a wonderful balance of sweet and tart.  I'm interested in your mum's recipe as it has so little sugar.  How well does it keep?  Does it need to be pasteurised in a hot water bath?  I find that low sugar jam gets mouldy or ferments, especially if I don't keep it in the fridge, whereas higher sugar jam doesn't need to be pasteurised and can be stored in a cupboard.",

Yesterday I was extra careful not to over cook them, I cooked them 3.5 minutes even though the package said 6, and they still became this sticky ball of noodles.

						"3. When the mixture has mostly stuck together, turn the mixture out on to a work surface. If the mixture feels dry, add another 5-10 ml of plant milk.",
						"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. Reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Repeat this for about 5 minutes, then work the coconut oil into the dough. To begin with the dough will be slippery and will look like it\u2019s been ruined. Keep working it and eventually all the fat will get absorbed by the dough and it will become elastic and smooth (it takes about 10 minutes).",
						"5. Put the dough in a large clean bowl, coat it in a thin layer of oil and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside, in a warm (but not too warm) place for 1-1\u00bd hours, until the dough doubles in size. Proceed to make the filling and the icing.",

The 1st time I missed the instruction to turn the bun over after sealing and they all opened when baking, but they actually turned out to still be super delicious (just more like a danish pastry). The 2nd time I figured out the key to sealing is to follow the tip about making the edges thinner than the center - the dough cooperates a LOT more than if the dough is all the same thickness.",

If anyone else has ADY instead of instant, what I did was keep the yeast out of the dry ingredients in the first step, then proof the yeast in the warm plant milk with a teaspoon of sugar, and then mixed it in with the dry ingredients and vanilla.

				"I was overjoyed to see this recipe on my Instagram feed. It sent me straight back to summers in Poland at my grandma\u2019s home :) I made these & they turned out yummy, but I had a bit of a dough problem. I remember following your recipe for drozdz\u00f3wki around Easter time, &  my dough had a similar issue. When I get to the kneading step, before adding the coconut oil, the dough is super crumbly & not very elastic. Even after adding the coconut oil, it breaks apart easily and is tough to knead. I tried to add a little more plant milk, and although this improved the texture, it definitely wasn\u2019t the same type of dough elasticity I\u2019ve experienced with breads. Do you have any idea what could be causing this/what to do next time? It causes my end product to be a tougher/harder texture and not as soft as I\u2019d like.",

I always preferred the ones filled with vanilla custard - I don't think my school sold jagodzinaki so I never tried one! :D but in the last few years my mum has been buying jagodzinaki from a bakery near her house which apparently are delicious but not vegan unfortunately so I don't know.I'm not having gluten (or sugar) because SIBO at the moment but will definitely make them once I can as a treat...!Speaking of being on a sentimental Polish cooking streak I've been living off Polish veggie soups pretty much throughout this whole summer (and quarantine.) My favourite one has been zupa botwinkowa...it's so so good and very easy to veganise.",

I even managed to get a few that didn't leak! (More leaked than didn't, but oh well.) I have never made filled buns like these before, so it was a fun new skill to learn.  Thanks!",
				"Yup! We're in the Appalachian Mountains, so that must have to do with the discrepancy. No matter, they came out just lovely!  I never had a jagodzianki before, so it was a fantastic new treat, thank you!",
				"Thanks, Ania! Who knows, maybe its something with the elevation or the weather here, but it rose overnight so now I can proceed! Thanks for the reply :) Looking forward to these treats!",
				"These look so lovely and are exactly the kind of fruit + bread combination to guarantee happiness! I love learning about the polish food you make -  the stories behind the recipes are always a highlight. Every year I go to a polish Christmas carol service here in New Zealand and there are all kinds of beautiful polish decorations and food made by the congregation. Just wondering about the buns: do you think there is any way to use frozen raspberries or blueberries... I'm worried that they might make things a little soggy but unfortunately can't find any fresh at the moment...Thank you!",
				"Hi! I was so excited to make these, but the dough never rose :( Any idea what went wrong? I know the yeast I used is good because I just used it yesterday for pizza dough.  Maybe it just needs more time?",

This time I was extra excited to find this recipe,Since it brings back a specific childhood memory from my grandmother who made this For  me while telling me about her own memories from Poland before the war has started.She passed away almost 30 years ago, and none of the family members could trace the recipeFor me.

				"Yes, I figured as it would be a bit too little otherwise :-) Thanks for your quick reply! I've made them in the meanwhile and will fry them shortly! \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Thanks for the recipe! I\u2019ve made this twice so far!Was wondering if you think this would do well with kale instead of spinach?",
				"I can\u2019t do flax/chia - do you think agar agar would work? Or pumpkin puree?TIA!",
				"I really enjoyed these, though based on feedback from my fiance I will be experimenting with the spices going forward. I plan to pair it with a lemon-\"cream\" sauce on the pasta too. One thing that did frustrate me was that the two hour chill time was not acknowledged in the prep or cook time. Thankfully, I caught it reading ahead, but the chill time takes this from a weeknight recipe to a weekend recipe. Thank you for all your recipes!",
				"is there a way to find out the nutritional information for all of your recipes? they look incredible but don't want to be too naughty but think I'm being good!",
				"These are so delicious, thank you! My friend's requested I make some for him- can these be made ahead by a day? Thanks!",
				"Really delicious recipe.  I subbed the spinach with lacinato kale and the breadcrumbs from almond flour - I loved it.",
				"Cooked mine in the air fryer and tucked a piece of feta into the centre. Delicious!",
				"Hi Ania. I want to try this as it looks amazing, and am wondering if Kale could work? I am addicted to Tuscan Kale (a healthy addiction if ever there was one), so maybe it could be substituted? The leaves are quite sturdy and strong.",
				"Hi Ania,I used  brownlentils to increase my protein dose, they came out really well. Thanks for the inspiration, i have linked your page to my recipe.",
				"These were brilliant and very like the Carluccio\u2019s ones. I added toasted pine nuts to the mix.",
				"These balls look fantastic Ania. Although I may try combining with some type of beans. I will report back !",
				"Are there any breadcrumbs you would recommend that are healthy-ish? Thanks!",
				"I saw this at the perfect moment as I've bought a huge bag of spinach and was wondering how to use it all up before it goes off! I love the combination of nutmeg, nutritional yeast and spinach. I wouldn't have usually tried those together, but they taste great and definitely remind me of Carluccio\u2019s.",
				"I made these yesterday and they were good, quite easy to do! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"I see you use large Oyster mushroom for the Vegan pasta dish. I am allergic to mushrooms. Any other suggestions?  Thank you.",
				"This looks amazing! What did you put on the pasta? Looks like pesto and chilli flakes?",
				"Hi Ania. Have you ever thought about getting an air fryer? I bought one and it is now my favourite appliance. I love the crispiness of things that are fried but know that frying in oil is not the best thing. The air fryer has solved that problem - little or no oil and fabulous crispiness! I think that these spinach balls would be great done in it. They sound delicious and I can hardly wait to try them out!",
				"Oh my gosh! This is one of mine and my sister\u2019s favourite dishes from Carluccio\u2019s. My sister has been vegan for a while, but as someone that\u2019s new to plant-based eating seeing this today has made my week! Can\u2019t wait to try it out. Thank you!",
				"Omigosh, I am now in heaven! I put spinach in and on EVERYTHING, and I have a beautiful garden full of it. Guess what I'm making for dinner! Thank you so much, this looks absolutely delicious."

				"Tried this today. Soooooo yummy",
				"Thank you for such a lovely dish. My family and I loved this beautiful meal. I made extra sauce with both canned and fresh tomatoes. I reserved some of the sauce to simmer in a pot on the stove while it was baking. I also added a slash of red wine and towards the end a little sweetener to balance it. The additional sauce came in handy as the oven dried out the sauce a bit and it was especially helpful when reheating leftovers. I served this with crusty bread and a fresh green salad of arugula, baby kale cucumber and toasted pumpkin seeds with a homemade Dijon garlic dressing. I was successful with a mandolin and it saved me so much time, and good news is all my fingers are in tact! Thank you again Ania \ud83d\udc9a",

				"Do you have the nutritional facts for any of your recipes ? I\u2019d like to see how many calories are in each serving so I don\u2019t go above my daily intake",
				"Hi Ania,I was sold on the picture of this, and it turned out as tasty as it looks! We've been eating a lot of ratatouille during lockdown and I was getting a bit fed up of courgettes to be honest, but this was the perfect  dish to get us to try something more adventurous. We completely forgot about the nutmeg, and I think we definitely went a bit overboard on the garlic, but it was absolutely delicious. As you say, slicing the courgettes is the trickiest part of the job (that was my department), and I definitely had a few rejects, but practice makes perfect! I might try the mandolin slicer next time, although that thing always scares me.Will save it for when we have guests next time, but thanks for a very tasty and unusual dish.",
				"I made it and it was lovely! My friend said he couldn't taste that it wasn't actual ricotta. I have to say it was quite some work, but I loved making it. I used a cheese slicer for the zucchini, and then stacked a few slices to roll it. That made it easier and a bit faster too, probably. I'll definitely make this again!",
				"This amazing dish impressed me and my guests: it looks great and the taste is wonderful. The recipe is so precise and real fun to cook. Thank you Ania.",
				"Hi Ania - making this as we speak.  I had problems slicing zucchini and therefore had to use skewers.  Any idea what to use the vegan ricotta for? It is delish!",
				"Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I made it for dinner and had leftovers for the freezer. It tastes wonderful.",
				"When I was in Italy, I tried something like that, but I never cooked at home. Now I will definitely cook. This is very tasty, thanks for sharing!",
				"Hi Ania. I will definitely try this as it looks filling and delicious! I have a question before I jump in: Do you need to skewer the rolls or do they stay rolled when cooking? I'm guessing when pressed together they don't un-roll but wanted you opinion.Best - Yvette",

Last week I discovered an inexpensive tool (\u00a36 at Dunelm) which does the job brilliantly and quickly and I'll definitely be making these more often now :DThe sauce is also really delicious - I used almond butter. Thank you Ania x",

It was only for two of us so I just made a small amount of filling for a few rolls but I'm glad I made the full amount of sauce as my husband loved it and was just eating it with a spoon by the end. I couldn't find tamarind concentrate so just used tamarind sauce from the worldfoods aisle in Asda and ended up getting rice paper from Amazon. After the first couple of wraps I'd got the hang of it but even the ugly ones I made tasted amazing. Thanks.",

Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together \u2013 add a touch more water if the dough is too dry to gather all of the flour in the bowl, but do it carefully. If you are not using yoghurt, your dough will require extra water for sure.",

						"2. Designate a space in the middle of your dough and arrange a thin layer of dry spinach mixture there, a few dollops of vegan feta on top and some more spinach to cover the feta \u2013 be careful not to overfill the parcel though. Cut the very edges of the dough off to ensure the seams aren\u2019t thick and unpleasant to eat and fold the sides over the spinach rectangle like a parcel (being careful not to trap too much air inside). Seal and roll over the parcel very gently with a rolling pin to seal all of the seams.",
						"3. Proceed in the same manner with the remaining 3 pieces of dough.",
						"4. Heat up a non-stick or griddle pan over a medium-low heat. Brush the first parcel with a little oil and place it, seam side down, on a pre-heated pan. Allow it to cook undisturbed for a few minutes until the pastry is cooked and nicely blistered. Brush the other side with a small amount of olive oil and turn the parcel over, again cook for a few minutes until the dough is just cooked. Proceed like this with the remaining 3 parcels.",

They are also way more dilling then I thought as I was only able to eat 2, but it was worrh it :) Our dough did end up being thicker for some reason, but 2nd times the charm haha! My family who has had the real version before also said it tastes almost identical!We were wondering though, how long can we freeze our feta cheese, and would we be able to immediately use it after defrosting? We made way too much cheese and sadly have no dough left for now, so we put it in the freezer, but we wanna be safe and know when we it should be used up. Dont wanna waste this super tasty feta!",
				"Looks delicious.  Can they be made ahead and frozen before cooking?  Also can you use frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed, in place of fresh?  Thx!",
				"This is the best gf dough I have ever tried. I made a major piggy of myself.  Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
				"This is excellent and a great snack to take to the beach the next day.",
				"So tasty! I didn\u2019t use feta as I just spontaneously made it. It was so easy and so tasty. Used the leftover the next day and still very tasty.",
				"Turned out divine! I spruced the filling by following the directions to your VEGAN SPANAKOPITA and made a GF dough with quinoa, oat and chickpea flour.",
				"Hi Ania! Other recipes for Gozleme online use yeast in the dough, how come you chose not to?Thanks,Aanch",
				"Looks good. I see the ingredients for the feta but not the instructions.  Are they all blended together? Thanks"

						"1\u00bd tbsp nutritional yeast",

					"SALAD": [
						"1. OPTIONAL STEP: You may want to pan-fry cold (that\u2019s important) potatoes in a little bit of oil. In that case, slice them into thick coins and fry in 1-2 tbsp of oil (I use mild olive oil) until golden on both sides. Allow them to cool down before making the salad.",
						"2. Heat up a griddle on a low-medium heat (you can also do them on a BBQ). Snap wooden ends off (and discard) the asparagus spears, place asparagus on a large, flat plate and drizzle with 1 tsp of olive oil. Roll the spears in the oil to coat. If you would rather not use any oil, steam or blanch asparagus instead.",
						"3. Once the griddle pan is ready, place oiled asparagus spears on it (make sure they do not overlap). Allow them to char for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then gently roll to the other side. They should be cooked but still retain a bit of a pleasant crunch.",
						"4. Transfer charred asparagus to a chopping board, season with sea salt and chop into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.",
						"5. Combine torn salad leaves, potato slices (pan-fried or just boiled), asparagus, cucumber, radishes, boiled peas, chopped capers (or gherkins) and chives in a large serving bowl. Drizzle with the sunflower dressing and sprinkle with fresh herbs (if using)."

				},
				{
					"DRESSING": [
						"1. Place drained sunflower seeds in a blender with about 180 ml / \u00be cup of soy milk initially. Blend until very smooth, adding a bit more soy milk if needed, but I found that adding \u00be cup to begin with allows me to get the silkiest texture.",
						"2. Flavour with the remaining ingredients and once you are happy with the flavour, adjust the consistency by adding an extra splash of soy milk if needed. You could also add some olive oil, but the dressing will no longer be oil-free, of course.",
						"3. The dressing keeps in a air-tight jar in a fridge for at least a week."

				"This is my new favorite salad - I make it every week! The only things I do differently are changing up the vegetables I use with the potatoes and making the dressing with Vegenaise instead of  the sunflower soy milk.",
				"Oh wow. Thank you so much for that Ania. This is a mini chopper and very low power. I will get a nutribullet as they are on sale ATM but in the mean time your trick seems good! I tried the dressing again with just oil and it was good but quite rich. Winter here so that's fine! It really is a delicious recipe and so glad to have the seeds instead of nuts. Very healthy.",
				"I added rice milk but would not really recommend as it was too watery. I think my blender is not cut out for seed/nut blending as well as I have had no luck with cashews. I added olive oil and blended for a long time. (I also nearly doubled the dressing ingredients to add to the seed puree as I like a lot of flavour...each to their own). At the end I thought it was very tasty and I was actually dipping vegies in it before I even made the salad! I'll try next time with olive oil from the start and see how that goes. Another great recipe Ania!",
				"Hi!  Is there an alternative for the miso paste? Thank you!",
				"Looks fabulous Ania. Can you recommend a soy milk alternative please? It can be tricky with the fat content and taste I know. I use rice milk if the recipe does not require much creaminess (and guessing the seeds will add that on their own) or almond milk if more fat is required, but not sure if the taste will balance.Thank you!"

We are living in Armenia at the moment and  asparagus season is over but I substituted a green vegetable called \u201cshushan\u201d in the local language (no idea what it is in English, never seen it back home!) and it was fantastic.

					]

				{
					"DOUGH": [
						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and turmeric (if using). Make a well in the centre and add olive oil and aquafaba. Mix it all with a spoon until it roughly sticks together. You may need to add a touch more aquafaba if the dough is too dry, if too wet, add a bit more flour.",
						"2. Knead the dough for at least 5 mins and then set aside for 30-60 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take a portion of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one (I don\u2019t). Cut the sheet in half \u2013 you will need two matching pasta sheets to form the top and bottom side of your ravioli.",
						"4. I used a ravioli mould (like this) but you can also just make them by hand, using a knife, pasta stamp or a cookie cutter instead. Place one pasta sheet on a lightly floured surface. Make small blobs of filling in neat rows leaving plenty of space around each blob so that each raviolo can be comfortably sealed. Place second pasta sheet on top, draping it over the blobs of filling. Press the pasta around each filling down with cupping hands to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or a pasta crimper. Double check each raviolo is sealed well.",
						"5. Put the finished ravioli on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you have used up all the dough and / or all the filling.",
						"6. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water boils, place a few ravioli (do not overcrowd the pot) in the boiling water and cook, on a rolling boil, for about 5 minutes. After the time is up, fish cooked ravioli out with a slotted spoon, shaking excess water off gently, and place them on a plate. Cook all the remaining ravioli in this way.",
						"7. To serve, baste them in olive oil, wild garlic pesto or make a simple creamy pasta sauce instead."

				"Recently all the tinned chickpeas I can find in various supermarkets are in salted brine, which seems  too salty to use as aquafaba to bake with. I'm pretty sure that the brine used to be salt and sugar? We noticed when we made hummous, using some of the aquafaba in order to use less oil and it was really salty! I know that cooking  dried chickpeas will result in nice aquafaba, but sometimes its easier just to open a tin... Any ideas?",

Return strained stock to the pot and whisk sweet potato / garlic / soy milk mixture in and finely grated garlic clove to add a bit of brightness to the soup. Warm up.",

				"Hi Ania,I would like to try this ramen recipe, though I have a question. I dont understand the course of operations of steps 5 and 6. You say in step 5 \"Saut\u00e9, stirring frequently the veggies\" and then in step 6 \" Remove the veggies from the oven\". How do I saut\u00e9 the vegetables if they're not already out of the oven? I'm French, maybe \"saut\u00e9\" is not  the same in English as in French, usually it means, stirring something in a saucepan over a medium heat, not baking in the oven. Did I miss something? I don't want to bother you with my questions or to be too fussy. It looks so delicious, that i want to be sure I understand things perfectly and that I don't ruin your gorgeous recipe in the end ;)Thanks for all your good work!",
				"Oh, I get It!!! Thanks so much Ania! I will definitely try this one, I truly love your recipes, I always find them very inspiring! x Fantomette",
				"This is the kind of cozy soup, which is perfect to warm up after frosty day. Very creamy, aromatic, full of flavour. Totally different from the ramen I've made so far, but absolutely delicious!",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Very delicious and nutritious :D",
				"With such beautiful photography of your creations, how can we not want to make these recipes?",
				"I am doing it now and I have a question - can I add tahini, mirin etc right to the pot, instead of  bowls? thanks!",
				"I made this last night, and wow - for a vegan ramen the flavor was amazing!! The depth of flavor with the broth, the creamy mix in and the flavorings you add at the bottom of the bowl  really create a rich ramen base. I was missing some key ingredients (kombu, celery and mushrooms) but I used half vegetable stock in place of the water for the broth and  it was still very flavorful! Will 100% make again.",
				"Had the house to myself for a few hours  earlier this week (a rarity during the pandemic) and decided to make this Vegan Ramen recipe. Wow! It is so good! Fortunately, my fianc\u00e9 is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so I get to eat it all by myself (our 4-year old granddaughter loved it at lunchtime today). The depth of flavors is amazing. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn\u2019t have any mirin for the flavorings in the bowl and added some sesame oil and black bean chili sauce to give it a kick. I plan to make a double or triple batch of the broth next time and freeze it. Thank you for this truly great recipe!",
				"Delicious recipe, best vegan ramen I\u2019ve ever had! Thank you for the recipe \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Delicious!  Made this last night and totally forgot to take a photo because we all started to eat too quickly.   The mixture of  the roasted sweet potato and garlic is a great idea ( I omitted the soy milk ) and is worth the effort . I added extra baby bok choy because it is a favourite vegetable of mine. This a a very versatile recipe as you can add what ever veggies are languishing in the fridge.",
				"We had this tonight with very little substitutes and it was really tasty. I also very much appreciate that you simplified the original recipe which I wouldn\u2019t have tried out, especially  not on a weekday with my baby in the other room :-)",
				"Hi Ania I am going to make your Vegan Laksa on the weekend but I also want to make this Ramen recipe too - however I do not like Celery (the taste and texture) is there a good vegetable I can substitute it with or is it ok to do without the celery. Many thanks Stefanie"

I chose to try this recipe over the others I was looking at because it was simple and didn't have cashews (too much work soaking, blending etc...)  My son (non-vegan) even liked it.  Guess next time I make it I'll have to make with mushrooms since he likes them and I can always pick them out lol.  Thanks for sharing will be keeping this one on hand to make often!!!",

				"Hi! This looks delightful. Any chance this could work as a bundt cake rather than muffins? Perhaps I'd need to keep it in the oven longer? Thanks!",
				"Thanks Ania. Would you wrap them in foil/clingfilm or just place in a box? :)",
				"Wonderful muffins! I have made them once so far and did not get a chance to freeze them yet but I am going to make a bigger batch next time and try to freeze them. Could you explain a little bit more how you freeze them? Do you freeze dough (prior to baking) or already baked muffins? How do you defrost them? Sorry for silly questions but I haven't frozen any cake/dough before ;)",
				"I'm not normally a fan of sweet potatoes in cakes, but these were stunning!!!",
				"Absolutely yummy! They taste very chocolaty and indulgent without being overly sweet!",
				"I was absolutely stunned by this recipe! I never knew healthy baking could taste this good, and these are just amazing - fluffy, light, chocolatey and rich. Even better than 'regular\u2018 muffins honestly. I am sure I will be making these over and over again :)",
				"These muffins are outstanding!! I make these at least once a month and keep them in the freezer so I always have them on hand. They freeze really well. I have made them exactly as written (yummmmm!!) but I do modify to reduce the fat content by cutting the almond butter in 1/2 and subbing unsweetened applesauce in its place and they still turn out amazing (so 1/4C almond butter and 1/4C applesauce). They taste just like a standard bakery muffin but without all the processed stuff. So good!! Thanks a million for this recipe, Ania!",
				"HI Ania,I've just found your blog, it looks fantastic and I can't wait to try lots of your recipes..I'd love to make your healthy  chocolate muffins and as am gluten-free will use g-free flour but as we go into this new lockdown we are quite low on maple syrup but I have loads of coconut sugar - do you think I could substitute exact quantities?Thanks, Fiona",
				"Can you make these with crunchy almond butter since this is what I have? My daughter gave me the recipe and raves about them",
				"Hi Ania, thanks so much for your swift reply earlier. I decided to experiment by making a half batch with banana instead of sweet potato, and if that was no good I was then going to use the link to the recipe in your reply  to me. However, the muffins have turned out  great, they are deliciously moist , fluffY and well risen! The only thing I would say, is that they took longer, 30 minutes till the skewer came out clean. I think maybe because mashed bananas are possibly more liquidy  than sweet potato, but this wasn\u2019t a problem anyway, just a slightly longer baking time. And you can taste the banana a bit too, but I like that. Thank you for a great recipe, I shall be using it often!",
				"Hi, I want to make these muffins but don\u2019t have sweet potatoes.  Can I sub bananas for the sweet potato ?  I specifically want to make muffins rather than a loaf cake. Thanks",
				"I just made them and my sweet potatoes were white skinned but when I cu t them open they were purple.  They were not very moist so my batter seemed pretty thick.  I added a few more splashes of oat milk.  How thick id the batter supposed  to be when you put it in the muffin tins?  They are in the oven now, so we will see.",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.I made this along with your recommended frosting from the sweet potato loaf recipe. Used a 24-mini cupcake tin.A hit! I had to hide these from my kids.The thing that took the longest was baking the sweet potato - everything else is a breeze. And... I just realized I didn't eat a single one. I... don't know how this happened. A first in my life.My husband and kids loved the taste :)",
				"Oh my gosh. These were amazing! I love eating chocolate cupcakes/muffins but have been trying not to make them since they're so bad for you! Now I can happily make these. :) They were awesome. Thanks for sharing.",
				"I want to say these muffins are Fantastic tasting..I made them for my daughter and son in law as they are true Vegans..They loved them since then have made them for my  Husband and I  ..now I am making them in a cake so looking forward to a slice of rich chocolate taste.Thank you so much for this recipe",
				"Hey Ania, thanks for the recipe! I made these 2 days ago and they were enjoyed by my non vegan friends. It got rave reviews and it was served among other less healthy (but also very yummy) vegan homemade treats, which says a lot about the quality of this recipe. I love your blog and often try out your recipes (or my variations on them). Keep up the great work!",
				"Hi Ania,really want to try these but I don't have a muffin tray, would that work on a rectangular baking tray? Any suggestions?",
				"These were absolutely amazing perfection. I frosted them with a chocolate frosting made out of only dates, vanilla extract, cashew butter and cocoa powder, and it took the muffins over the top. I also divided the muffins into two 6 inch cake pans and made a cake out of it with the frosting. Thanks for the recipe.",
				"Ooh Ania, these are waaaay too good. They are light and fluffy and go down too easily. I ate 2: the least of everyone here! But even so, I think I either need to stop making your recipes or up my workouts...I\u2019ll be back. \ud83d\ude0b Thanks for another winner.",
				"Hi! I\u2019d like to make these today but I don\u2019t have any milk. Is there any way I can substitute it?Thank you! Teresa",
				"Mine are currently in the oven! How long do these keep & what's the best way to store them? Thanks!",
				"These muffins are amazing! Thank you for the recipe :-) I used GF flour and macadamia milk and they turned out fudgy and super delicious. My kids are obsessed and  they will definitely be  a staple sweet treat in our house x",
				"I just baked these and they are amazing!! Thank you so much for such a simple and delicious recipe xx",
				"Do you think these would work with almond flour?",
				"These look delicious! I'm thinking I could sub pumpkin for the sweet potato. Will definitely be making these soon!",
				"I'm anxious to try these. I don't have any sweet potatoes but may have some canned pumpkin on hand. I think that would work because sweet potato pie and pumpkin pie  are almost identical.  I'll let you know. Needing some sweets myself!",
				"Can I make these with canned sweet potatoes?",
				"Hi Ania,Looks delicious.Would you know if these freeze well?Thank you!",
				"Hi Ania. I love the idea of using sweet potato in these muffins but I am wondering if I could adapt the recipe to not use chocolate so that I could make blueberry or apple or whatever else muffins. If I left out the cocoa powder would I need to add more flour or would that make the muffins too dry? So glad that you are feeling better. I missed your recipes for a while there. It felt like missing a friend :)"

				{
					"BUNS": [
						"1. Mix flour, sugar, salt and instant yeast in a large mixing bowl. If using maple syrup do not add it yet.",
						"2. Stir in warmed up plant milk. If using maple syrup (or other liquid sweetener), use 60 ml / \u00bc cup less plant milk and add maple syrup to the milk before adding to the dry ingredients.",
						"3. Stir everything together with a large wooden spoon. You may need to add a tablespoon or so more milk if the mixture is too dry to stick together roughly at this point but do so very gradually. When the mixture has mostly stuck together turn the mixture out on to a work surface or bread\u00a0board.",
						"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. You then reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Halfway through the kneading incorporate coconut oil (solid not melted) into the dough. It will make the dough slippery at first, you might think it has been ruined \u2013 but it has not, it will make for a richer dough. Keep on kneading and the dough will become elastic and smooth soon. In total the kneading should take about 15 minutes for this amount of dough.",
						"5. When the dough is smooth, form it into a ball and coat in a thin layer of oil. Place in a large mixing bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm!) until it has doubled in size \u2013 about 1 hr. It\u2019s a good idea to take a photo of the dough at the beginning so that you are sure when it has doubled in volume. While the dough is proofing, make the filling (see FILLING section below).",
						"6. Once the dough has doubled in size, empty it out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",
						"7. Roll the dough into a large rectangle that is about 36 cm / 14\u2033 wide. The height depends how swirly you want the buns, the thinner the dough the more swirls and therefore filling your buns will end up with \u2013 40 cm / 15\u00be\u201d height is what mine was.",
						"8. Spread a thin layer (you don\u2019t want the buns to end up soggy) of blended rhubarb all over the rolled out dough. Sprinkle evenly (!) with finely chopped candied ginger and raw rhubarb slices making sure they land on their sides for the most part.",
						"9. Starting from the bottom, roll the dough tightly so that you end up with a 36 cm / 14\u2033 long \u201cdough snake\u201d.",
						"10. Now, depending on your baking dish, divide the dough into 9 or 12 even (4-3 cm / 1.5 \u2013 1.1\u2033) segments. I find that a square or round dish, like mine, needs 9 and a rectangular one needs 12 pieces. Use a long piece of sewing thread to do the cutting as it does not squash the filling as much as a knife does. Place the thread under the snake and overlap the thread on the top of the snake where you want the cut to be, pull tight to cut.",
						"11. Place the segments, swirls face up, on a lightly oiled baking dish, leaving 1-2 cm between each bun. If you can fill the baking tray, this is ideal.",
						"12. Leave the buns (covered with a kitchen towel) to prove again for another hour. Toward the end of this time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F.",
						"13. Brush the buns with the maple syrup + plant milk glaze and bake them for about 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Cover the top with a piece of kitchen foil if you find that they are browning too quickly.",
						"14. While the buns are baking, create the icing by combining a tablespoon or so of the rhubarb puree with icing sugar and mixing really well.

				"Hi Ania, these look amaaaaaazing! Do you think they would hold up with the addition of strawberries? I love that combo and would like to try it in something other than a cake/crisp.",
				"Garden rhubarb is ready for harvest  and when I looked for a recipe that was not a crisp, this one looked amazing. Rhubarb spread, diced rhubarb and rhubarb icing give ithe swirls the tart flavor we love. We would forego the candied ginger next time and add a little more salt. I used  fresh. Ginger in the rhubarb sauce and that was enough for us. These are moist, spicy, sweet and tart. We made them before starting on a trip and enjoyed them at the airport before our morning flight! They travel so well!",
				"Fab recipe, and so easily adaptable! I made these last year and combined them with a different recipe using sourdough, which worked a treat. This year, I managed to get hold of the bright pink rhubarb for that zingy pink drizzle and it looks so stunning! Such a yummy bake and so easy. I'll definitely be making these again soon.",
				"So delicious!!   I often find vegan baking quite difficult but this recipe was easy to follow - the perfect sweetness and relaxing to make!",
				"Has anyone tried making these with frozen rhubarb?",
				"They're my go-to recipe :P I also made a babka with cocoa and dates filling. Give it a go :)",
				"Hi Ania, these buns look amazing!Can I ask you what the difference between this dough and the one that you used for your (amaaaazing) sugar-free cinnamon rolls is?Thanks, Giada",
				"I can report back and say that it worked really well! I put them in the fridge before the second rising and covered them in cling film. They rose nicely in the fridge overnight. Definitely a trick I\u2019ll use again.",
				"Quick question, do you think it would be possible to do the dough the day before and leave it in the fridge overnight before baking? I would like to make it for my family tomorrow, but with the proofing, it would mean I\u2019d have to get up way too early!",
				"These look incredible!! However, I'm entirely gluten free so I was wondering if you have any recommendations on how to make them gluten free (I try to stay away from the gluten free flour blends as well as they make me feel off)? Thanks in advance, love your blog!",
				"I'm sorry to hear you and Duncan came down with the virus, and relieved to read that you both recovered (I don't know you, I don't want to sound like a stalker, I just happen to love your blog haha!) :)These buns looks gorgeous, I'd love to try them once I can share them with friends and family again, but I've only ever found green rhubarb (even when it's pink on the outside), I never understood how it could have such a pretty pink color in all the recipes I find on the Internet!",
				"Hello! Thank you for the recipe! But can i do it without yeast? Or maybe substitute?",
				"This looks lovely, can't wait to try. So sorry you were sick, thankful you are better now!",
				"Oops...forgot to  leave stars...",
				"Ania, I have  followed your lovely  blog for a long time, and wondered if you were OK  after an unprecedented gap.  So glad you are both better. We have rhubarb in our garden...and will be making these today...look  completely irresistable. Keep well everyone.",
				"Good to know that works too! I learn so much from you as well! Keep it up great post.",
				"Well done you two.. back from the other side! How\u2019s the sitting room going? Have you had to put the sofa and rug on hold?",
				"This sounds like a delightful combination, I love rhubarb and feel it is often an overlooked friend. I am really glad you are both feeling better, that must have been terrible. <3",
				"It looks a bit too complicated for me, but my oh my, is that a beautiful dish!!!",
				"This recipe looks amazing, and I'm very excited to try it. I was wondering if I could use freshly grated or chopped ginger instead of ginger stem in syrup for this?"

				"1. Wash wild garlic leaves really well and blot them with a kitchen towel or simply leave to air-dry.",
				"2. Dry-roast your almonds (or any other nuts or seeds). You can either do it on a hot, dry pan making sure you shake it regularly so that they do not burn. They are done when lightly charred in places and fragrant. Alternatively, you can roast them in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven but be aware that this works better for larger quantities or else they burn rather quickly. I tend to roast 2 cups of nuts at a time for about 10-12 minutes. Allow them to cool down completely before blending in the pesto.",
				"3. Grind almonds first, then add all the remaining ingredients apart from olive oil and salt and blitz well. I used 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup of lemon juice in my pesto, as I like things to be lemony, so you may want to adjust the amount to your taste. Once everything is minced well, start trickling in olive oil while the motor is going. Taste and add salt to taste \u2013 if using capers, you will only need a touch, otherwise more like 1 tsp.",
				"4. Slice your courgette really thinly using the lowest setting on a mandolin.",
				"5. Heat up 2 tsp olive oil on a large steel frying pan and add courgette slices. Saute lightly, stirring frequently until no longer raw and browned in places.",
				"6. Cook pasta al dente, reserving a little of the pasta cooking water just before draining.",
				"7. Coat the drained pasta in a few tablespoons of pesto, adding a little pasta cooking water to loosen things up a touch. Divide between two plates, top with courgette slices and toasted (and chopped if large) nuts / seeds and chilli flakes if you like.",
				"8. Transfer the remainder of your pesto to a clean jar and top with an extra tablespoon of olive oil to prevent mould from setting in. Store in the fridge for 2-3 weeks."

				"This recipe is to DIE for! I'm a pretty picky eater myself, but ever since going vegan I've noticed that I actually enjoy more foods then I thought, so I decided to give this recipe a try with my family, even though I usually prefer red pesto's made with sundried tomatos more and don't often enjoy a lot of toppings. I'm so happy that we decided to make it, as me and my entire family fell in love! It has a strong but amazing taste, and as our culture uses a lot of spices, we usually end up wanting more taste/spices in a recipe, but this was just perfect. We used pumpkin seeds as we didn't have any others, and decided to add some green beans for some extra protein! It was really tasty, and the green beans added a nice simple crunch. I do plan to cut the greenbeas a bit thinner or smaller next time to mix it better or opt for roasted chickpeas, either way it's a very easily adjustable recipe and so tasty! We still have some leftover sauce and I'm definitely gonna be using it again. I have a lot of recipes of yours that I've been wanting to try ever since I found this website 3 days ago, and after this amazing pesto recipe I'm very excited to try more of your amazing cooking! Thank you <3",
				"So delicious!",
				"I made this tonight substituting in your original wild garlic pesto because my son arrived home yesterday with a bag full of leaves and I didn't have any capers. Such a simple sounding dish but packed full of flavour, quick and easy to make and voted delicious by said son who is not a willing plant-based person. Will definitely be making this again very soon. Thanks, Ania, for a great recipe!",
				"Another lovely recipe :-) I added some spinach at the end to mine, which worked nicely. I do hope you're feeling better Ania.",
				"Great tips! Will definitely some of these for our home. Enjoy reading your posts!",
				"I really love your recipes - we have loads of wild garlic near where I live and I\u2019ve hardly used it before so it\u2019s nice to see a recipe using it. I\u2019m also very grateful for the glorious sunshine we\u2019re having at the moment   Life is beautiful despite what\u2019s going on around the world.",
				"Cze\u015b\u0107 Ania,what do you think, if one wants to make a batch which could make pasta happy longer than 2-3 weeks, what  ingredient could be an option to keep it longer fresh and alive?Or is that far beyond the science of preserving? ;)"

						"2. Blend in drained and rinsed cashews until the mixture is silky smooth. As opposed to other cashew creams I  made on here, this mixture needs to be fairly loose as this allows for some of the moisture to evaporate during baking and prevents the filling from drying out too much."

Repeat this for about 5 minutes, then work the coconut oil into the dough. To begin with the dough will be slippery and will look like it\u2019s been ruined. Keep working it and eventually all the fat will get absorbed by the dough and it will become elastic and smooth (it takes about 10 minutes) .",

						"6. Once the dough has doubled in size, punch all the air out of it and divide it into 6 or 7 identical portions.",

						"8. Heat up the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.",

				"Hello, This recipe looks amazing! I look forward to trying it. I don't have any instant yeast, I only have active dry yeast. Can I use that in the recipe? If so, how would I use it with this recipe? Thanks so much!",
				"OMG, these came out Amazing! I made them twice and both times were fabulous!",
				"What a lovely recipe! I saw these on Instagram and made them immediately. I prepared the dough in the evening, let it rise overnight in the fridge, shaped and proofed in the morning. I used light spelt flour and olive oil, kneaded by hand. For the cashew cream, I used oatly barista and coconut sugar, ~50 ml lemon juice and cinnamon, omitted the coconut oil. The cashew cream by itself is delicious and the flavour (to me) is similar to that of sweetened tvorog. The recipe makes a lot, ~3x what you need for 1 batch of buns. I have also made these buns with rum-soaked raisins, marzipan, dark chocolate, strawberry jam, and with a rye and oat crumb topping. It\u2019s easier for me to brush the buns with maple syrup + splash of hot water after they come out of the oven, as opposed to doing the prebake \u201cegg wash\u201d. When we can travel again, I will definitely make these for long drives because they\u2019re not messy and keep me full. Thank you, Ania. I\u2019m looking forward to trying some more of your recipes!",
				"In the dough it says to add vanilla extract but it\u2019s not on the ingredient list for the dough. What measurement do I use?",
				"Yes - just the cream. Great. Thanks V much",
				"Hi  - i made twice the amount of cashew cream because I got the ratios wrong in the first batch so had to double up. Do you know if i can freeze it?? Thanks you!",
				"Tried the recipe for my family and they loved it :) it was a little emotional moment for me to remind myself of my roots and introduce my wife to this, I used to devour these as a little kid after whole day of playing outside with my mates and I was a little worried the kids wouldn't like the polish sweets but they made a giant mess after eating so that's  the perfect proof they enjoyed it. Dzi\u0119ki za pi\u0119kny powr\u00f3t do lat m\u0142odo\u015bci! Pozdrawiam!",
				"Any particular reason you think firm tofu would work better here than silken?",
				"Hi \ud83d\ude0a. These look lovely and I plan to make over Easter. Do you think I could kneed in the machine as I am way too lazy to do by hand \ud83d\ude09. Thanks x",
				"Merci beaucoup pour ces recettes vegan  dans lesquelles je puise tr\u00e8s souvent. Celle-ci est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante. La cr\u00e8me a le go\u00fbt du kasekuchen de mon enfance. Je viens de faire cette recette et c\u2019est d\u00e9licieux.Merci",
				"I made these today and they were wonderful! All the kneading was very therapeutic ha. I messed up the filling and added both the maple syrup and the milk, but it still came out fine, I just had extra filling. Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!",
				"Thanks! My dough definitely did not turn out as nice and shiny as yours. Do you have a video of how you stretch it out properly? I believe all my measurements and ingredients were done correctly. My dough looked more like pizza dough, it was not smooth.",
				"Should the coconut oil be melted?",
				"Hi Ania, thank you so much for the wonderful recipies you create, I always have my Vegan and non-Vegan friends clamouring for more!                                                                             I have just made a lemon drizzle cake and an orange version and we're looking forward to diving into them later. However I have also tried to make these Polish Sweet Cheese Rolls this afternoon. They're not finished yet (the dough is on its second rise); however I found the dough remained extremely dry, even before I added the oil, so I wasn't able to stretch it as you suggested and resorted to kneeding it as best I could. I used Coconut sugar, so added a little extra milk to ensure there was enough moisture, so I'm not sure why the dough was so dry?  I know I have measured correctly and used fresh ingredients but it certainly didn't double in size.                                                                                                                                                                          We will of course try them and I hope my fears are unfounded; but is this something you have come across before or do you have any suggestions please?   Many thanks Ann x",
				"Hi Ania,Me again... due to isolation and low stocks I only have self rising wholewheat flour will that be fine for this recipe? Thank you x",
				"Wooaahh!!  This is amazing recepie, this sweet rolls are also tradition in my homecountry Latvia, I should give a try to this cuz all ingriedients I have at home and since I become vegan I was missing this simple cheese rolls so much! Yammy...Thank you for creating this recepie for us! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude00\ud83c\udf69",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for your response. Because the recipe says \"1/2 + 1 tbsp\" of plant milk, I added 1 1/2 tbsp initially. However, after consulting with a friend, we realized that you may have meant \"1 cup + 1 tbsp\" of plant milk, which more properly equates to 135 ml. Is this the case?",
				"Are you sure the ratios for the dough ingredients are correct? When I followed your dough recipe I ended up having to add a cup or more of milk in order to make it come together. A few tablespoons of dough doesnt seem possibly sufficient. That said, this is a wonderful recipe and I will be making again.",
				"Dear Ania, Thank you for this creative recpie. I have never ate anything like this. But I will give it a try! Corona is not well for the peace of mind, health, the economy , and many other things,  but also not for my waistline. In order to keep my mind of checking the news, I keep on baking. I have made your Portugese Custard tarts, raspberry bakewell pie, scones in one week! My husband loved them! Tahnk you for providing a bit of comfort in these confusing times! Dear blog readers, Ania & Duncan, please be safe and healthy!Love from the Netherlands",
				"Do you think the dough will work with gluten free flour?",
				"Hi, I'm a vegetarian and not a vegan. I know I know I did tried but just couldn't do it. Instead of using \"vegan\" cheese what can I use?  Ricotta? It's a shame that my Polish grandmother dies when I was an infant so she never cooked for me.Thank you. Stay safe.",
				"Hi,These look delicious and somewhat similar to what my Mom used to make!Is instant yeast different from active dry yeast?Thank you for the great posts!Stay well!",
				"This looks delicious and a definite comfort food in these crazy times!If I use tofu for the filling, does this replace only the cashews?",
				"Can I use spelt flour instead of wheat flour?",
				"Thank you so much for all you do! Wishing you and your family health and stability in this crazy time. I bet you could use soaked raw  deskinned almonds instead of cashews! I have used almonds as substitute for vegan cheese many times when cashews weren't on hand.",
				"I saw your post on Instagram and had to check out this recipe! This looks so much like our Finnish rahkapiirakka which I miss so much. Sadly 2 of my kids (adult kids) are allergice to cashews, but, I'm wondering if the almond ricotta would work in this? I may try this weekend to make these. I'm a nurse and I am working full-time, but, this weekend we are all at my home (except 1 son). Everyone but my husband and I are able to work from home. I know what you mean about getting sucked into the vortex of the updates. I'll let you know how they turn out!!"

Once the water comes to the boil, decrease the heat down to low and let the rice cook until it has absorbed all of the water. Once all the water has been absorbed, switch the heat off (but do not lift the lid) and let the covered pot sit on a warm hob for another 5-10 minutes to finish off cooking in its own steam.",

						"3. Once they come to the boil (make sure the sugar has dissolved), pour the pickling liquid over the radishes and allow the liquid to cool down. Store any leftover in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."

				{
					"SESAME ENCRUSTED TOFU": [
						"1. Drain the tofu and press it well, until all the excess moisture is squeezed out so that it is primed for absorbing the marinade. This is the tofu press I use.",
						"2. Mix ground up flax or chia seeds with 60 ml / \u00bc cup water and place in the fridge for the mixture to jellify.",
						"3. Make the marinade / dressing by combining soy sauce (or tamari), rice vinegar, maple syrup, toasted sesame oil and minced ginger.",
						"4. Cut the pressed tofu into 1 cm / 0.42\u2033 thick 7 cm / 2.75\u2033 square slices and place at the bottom of a baking dish. Pour the marinade you\u2019ve prepared in the previous step over the tofu and allow it to soak in.",
						"5. Place flour and sesame seeds on two plates and jellified flax in a shallow bowl.",
						"6. Set the oven to  220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F. Alternatively, you could also shallow fry your tofu like I did in this recipe.",
						"7. Lift a piece of tofu out of the marinade, press it into the flour to coat it lightly, then dip it into the flax egg (allow any excess to drip off) and finally press it into the sesame seeds making sure the entire surface is tightly packed with them. Place on a clean plate and proceed to coat the rest of the tofu in the same manner.",

						"3. Place filling ingredients on top: a layer of pickled carrot and / or radish, sesame encrusted tofu, cucumber slices, a layer of avocado and fresh spinach. Dollop some vegan mayo, Sriracha or Sriracha mayo under the tofu steak if you like.",
						"4. Once you are done with your stack, seal all four corners of the nori sheet on top of the filling. Fold the right corner over the stack, wet the end of the nori sheet with a wet finger and fold the left corner over the stack and \u2018glue\u2019 it to the right corner. Repeat the same thing with the bottom and top corners until you get a small packet.",
						"5. You may want to wrap it tightly in a clean kitchen towel to help the onigirazu keep its shape. Set aside to let the seaweed soften a little and cut in half with a sharp knife before eating or packing away."

				"This turned out beautifully. So delicious, right amount of sweetness, and the perfect flavour from the almond flour. I have made many a lemon cake and I usually get some sort of unfavourable result (middle caving in, not the right texture, not the right flavour, etc) but this one looked as beautiful as the photo. Perfect recipe,  will be my new go-to lemon loaf.",
				"I made this cake into a Polish Easter babka and it worked so well! I was anxious about getting it out of the form but I didn't have to worry, it came out very easily - thank you for the recipe, can't wait to try it :))",
				"The cake is absolutely delicious! So indulgent (at least for me, I very rarely bake) - half of it is gone already and I'm doing Easter solo haha ;)I was wondering if you could give me advice whether I could tweak this recipe to make it almond flavoured? My grandma always bakes an almond babka for Easter and her recipe is looks difficult to veganise so I thought I could adapt your recipe since the texture is very similar. I was thinking of removing most of the lemon juice, zest and poppy seeds and replace it with more milk and add a few drops of almond flavourig (she adds that to her recipe) - does it sound like it could work? Your option would be much appreciated! :)",
				"Thank you for your tips, you're the best!! I made all the changes and it came out absolutely delicious and very close to what I remember my grandma's babka tasted like. The texture is so spot on! I wrote down the exact quantities and I'd be happy to share (although I did pretty much what I said in my previous post)",
				"Another amazing recipe. Absolutely delicious, light, simple and an easy crowd pleaser. Lasted a whole week in the tin and really moist. I added more zest and lowered the sugar a little as I love the tang. Thanks again!",
				"This is absolutely delicious and a doddle to make",
				"This recipe looks amazing! I was wondering - do you think it would work well with wholemeal flour and brown sugar? I know it would look totally different, but I only usually have panela sugar in the house!Thanks very much x",
				"thanks! I'll try it and let you know :-)",
				"Hello can I use ground almonds with skin on or it has to be almond flour? thank you.",
				"What a delicious cake, thanks so much for the recipe!I love your blog, I know I can trust that every recipe you publish is an instant success here!",
				"In love with this recipe! It only lasted 2 days in our house. Keen to make it one of my staples. Thanks so much",
				"This cake is so delicious! I made it for my dad\u2019s birthday and it was a winner! Your recipes work so well and are a great way to introduce people to really good, tasty vegan food.",
				"Hello,I def try this recipe however I've a question for you. My icings always become so grainy and you can feel the sugar granules when you are eating it. How should I prevent this problem? Many thanks!",
				"I made this loaf for a family get together and it was delicious! I added the lemon syrup after baking but I think it made it a bit too sticky (I only added half but next time I\u2019d only add a quarter). Mine sunk in the middle a smidge like others have said but I didn\u2019t mind, it tasted delicious! Thanks!",
				"Wow - seriously  the best thing I have baked in quite some time. The addition of the almond flour makes this so unique. Thank you for this gorgeous recipe.",
				"I made your cake and it is absolutely DELICIOUS! So fluffy yet a bit moist, perfect balance of sweet and sour and the crunch from the poppy seeds and blended almonds, oh, simply beautiful! Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe! :)",
				"I already made this cake twice and it is delicious. The second time I used 100gr of sugar instead of 150gr, which i personally prefer. Sadly my cakes were pretty crumbly. Do you have any tips to make the cake less crumbly? Thanks :)",
				"I've already made this muliple times for my in-laws and it's the only thing they ask for now. I've even been tasked with making this at Christmas time. It's a gorgeous bake, thank you so much for sharing it. I honestly just come straight to you for everything baking now as I always can rely on the fact it's always going to be super tasty. Thanks!",
				"Sooo delicious!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!",
				"I  love this recipe and have made it 3 times  only problem is mine sinks in the middle every time.  Still great but wonder if you have any tips to help?Thanks",
				"This came out yummy. I used earth balance butter instead of coconut oil. It was a very delicious pound cake - very rich and moist. The glaze was a perfect addition. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I had some cute Star Wars Muffin liners and wanted to surprise my boyfriend with May the 4th-Star Wars  muffins during the lock-down. I never baked with poppy seeds before but bought them last week for another recipe (what are the chances). The ingredients are so simple and  staples in our house. I used half the recipe and  got 5 muffins out of it (baked at roughly 18 minutes).  I like muffins as you can freeze them easily as well.  Haven't tried them yet but my bf loved them! Thanks for a easy recipe that doesn't require a ton of washing up",
				"This is the best vegan cake I have ever made! And I made a whole lot of them. Can\u2019t wait to try more of your recipes!",
				"I made this recipe into muffins and they are absolutely delicious. Moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you very much....",
				"This cake sounds amazing! Do you think I could substitute coconut flour, buckwheat flour or rice flour? Not sure my local shop does GF flour and things a bit tricky to travel further at present....  ;-)ThanksJules",
				"This was great!  Easy to make and delicious.",
				"I made this recipe yesterday! I didn't have poppy seeds, so instead I used toasted black sesame seeds as an alternative! It worked out very nicely, and gave it a different character, while still providing the crunch, and earthiness you'd like from the poppy seeds! It had a slight savory flavor that actually complimented the cake nicely!",
				"Thank you for sharing these amazing recipe with us, I cannot wait to prepare thjis amazing recipe and taste it myself and see how well it tasted and cooked also sharing it with my friends and family as well for their future reference.",
				"Just made this (without the icing) and love the flavor. I used coconut oil, plain, unsweetened soy milk, and granulated sugar (didn't have caster). I added about 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt. Mine only needed 40 minutes in the oven, but it's a gas oven from 1947 so the flames make for a different heat. Sadly, I didn't wait quite long enough for it to cool off before I tipped it out of the loaf pan, so it stuck and cracked. Still delicious! The subtly almond and coconut flavors, not too sweet, are delightful.",
				"This looks amazing! I don\u2019t have almonds, can I use more flour?!",
				"I love ANYTHING lemon and poppy seed, can\u2019t wait to try it!"

				"Is there a reason you use flax/chia egg instead of just plantbased milk? I used ground up chia but it was too thick to stick to the tofu, and it just pushed away the flour when I tried to press it on, so I subbed it for oat milk. Still, delicious tofu \ud83d\ude0b We ate it in a poke bowl with soybeans, mango, pickled red onion, rice and avocado. Made a peanut based sauce to go on top of everything.  Thanks for posting!",
				"You have switched me onto tofu in a big way Ania! I love the option to marinade, then bake, then coat with sauce as per the peanut sate recipe but this is also a great way to eat tofu. I cut the tofu into small cubes as I love getting the fried/baked crunch. Sesame seeds are an awesome substitute for breadcrumbs as well. The flax seed coating worked really well. P.S. You photos of the meals are really spectacular!",
				"This was delicious, I subbed fried shallots for black sesame seed (I still wanted it to look pretty) and the flavours worked a treat!! The only thing I would say is that I found the tofu a tad bland in the middle however it may have been due to the thickness of my steaks; either way, a quick soy and sesame dipping sauce cleared that right up! Super easy and definitely looks gorgeous",
				"I love sesame seeds so think I was quite liberal with the amount I used. I also bought in black sesame seeds for this as you suggested using both and so glad I did it gave it something extra.",
				"We made these this evening and used more sesame seeds than stated but that's ok because sesame seeds rock! Also when frying they spat quite a bit so we decided to bake them, they weren't as golden as the few we fried but jwere crispy and ust as tasty. The marinade is yummy. Thanks for posting.",

I used chia seeds instead of flax but found  they didn't stick to the tofu perfectly (edible but not as pretty as yours!) so will try flax next time, maybe I did something wrong?..

I really hope that this difficult time will lead to something beautiful and true.  I feel very close to anyone who is struggling right now, maybe because of what is happening here in Italy. May the force be with us :)Silvi",

I know I mentioned to you Dr. Joe Dispenza before... and no I don't make any money from sharing his work, and I haven't healed my body - yet, but I'm doing the work (meditations, and more) but hundreds have. Recently I listened to this testimonial from someone named Amy and it was freaking amazing, and might help you, I hope so."

Place a heaped tablespoon (do not overfill as rice needs room for expansion) of the filling at the bottom of each leaf, fold the sides to the middle and then roll the leaf gently (not too tightly) until the filling is safely enclosed inside. Place it snugly in the prepared baking dish, the seam down. Continue with the remaining leaves in the same manner.",

I make batch cook these and freeze some to really make my efforts count. :) One thing I wanted to mention was that the second time I made these I decided to steam the whole cabbage and peel off leaves as they became softer instead of boiling a few leaves at a time.  I didn't blanch them but I didn't notice a difference in the final result and it was so much easier.",
				"Thank you for your reply! Yes, I was thinking that I would have to buy a very expensive camera. I was stagnating because I thought the first step was the find the perfect camera. But, I now realize I just gotta settle on one and just start practicing. So many things go into making a good photograph like lighting and editing....and how you arrange the food. The dousing the cabbage in cold water seems like a cool trick. I'll try it!",
				"Looks so colorful and drool-worthy! Not only do you come up with cool recipe ideas, you are an amazing photographer too! The picture of you spooning a spoon of brown rice into the cabbage leaf was absolute perfection! I have never tried photography before. Just my iPhone camera. And, I can never get my pictures to look this tempting. What camera and lens do you use to get get such amazing shots? And, how do you make the cabbage look so vibrant green?

Not one to throw anything out, however, I unrolled each and scraped the mushroom/rice mixture into a saucepan. Added water to cover about an inch over the top and put on a medium heat. Then let it cook until rice was tender and water absorbed. It made the most delicious porridge that I ate over several days.  So good that I'm wondering how to replicate without going through all the cabbage roll steps!I ate the  green cabbage separately with a little mustard.",

				"Hi Ania, I don\u2019t know really anything about you and I am new to your blog. I was looking for cabbage rolls but after reading your comments I feel compelled to share.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, along with other health issues. When I became pregnant with my son all my symptoms worsened exponentially. Everyone tried to act as if it were perfectly normal to feel like hell when pregnant but I couldn\u2019t accept that. After trying just about every fad diet on the planet (all pushed even by my  \u2018alternative\u2019 ND and midwife) I simply prayed to The Universe in desperation for some kind of answer. Then  I \u2019accidentally\u2019 stumbled upon Medical Medium. After adapting my diet more and more to fit what he recommends I can say that not only do I feel fully recovered from my pregnancy but actually more healthful , vital and whole than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. You\u2019re already vegan so you\u2019re on the right track but there are some other trouble makers even in a vegan diet that can cause issues. Additionally there are specific cleanses and supplements that he outlines in a very detailed fashion to help address every single symptom under the sun. AND he actually explains why these different ingredients cause issues and why certain symptoms exist far beyond the current medical scope. If you are open to healing through a healthy diet of  plant based foods  then I would strongly encourage you to at  least check him out. And back to the topic, these look delish! I would also love to see a traditional recipe from your blog since it has so much yummy polish food already.  I will be subbing coconut aminos though for the soy as that is sadly on the list of trouble-makers. Wishing you the best. \ud83d\udc9a",
				"Hi Ania, I\u2019m glad to hear things are going well and hope your therapist is a great fit. I have been loathe to mention it as I know you try to be naturally healthy but from personal experience I can recommend Aropax for depression and  Lexapro for ongoing OCD or anxiety muffling. The former for just a while, the latter, in reduced dose as a daily maintenance .  I\u2019m sure you will want to explore all avenues but this is just a thought as they worked so well for me. PS i think you\u2019re a beautiful writer.. maybe there\u2019s a bookin this? Big hug. \ud83d\ude43\u2764\ufe0f",

				"These look amazing and I can\u2019t wait to make them. Do you think they will freeze? Also I am thinking about making it with strawberries as well, think that could be an issue?",
				"Hi Ania, thanks for all your wonderful recipes - I\u2019ve made many of them several times (especially the frangipanes!) and they\u2019re always delicious. I\u2019m keen to try these as we have some rhubarb. However I\u2019m not really confident using agar - I have both flakes and powder, but it\u2019s not clear to me whether I need to activate them in the amount of water specified on the packet, or only to use the liquid that is already included in your recipe. For example, how would you use these flakes to achieve the right consistency ? https://www.clearspring.co.uk/products/japanese-agar-flakes-sea-vegetable-gelling-agent (There\u2019s a link to show the usage instructions on the page).Your help/expertise would be much appreciated! Many thanksMatt"

				"What\u2019s the best vegan brunch meal",
				"Wow, really? I knew from reading some of your other posts that I recognized something about your way of presenting information. Turns out it is depression, which we have in common. It is such a personal issue, so I can relate to the worry of either writing too much or being disingenuous. But now you\u2019ve made me very curious about what it is you have discovered... haha. My greatest takeaways are always from stories, so I would love to maybe read yours at some point. I am fascinated by the unconscious ways we are drawn to others with similar issues. My trust in official therapy methods is quite low, because of their reductionism - I only found through my art that it was my induced conservative-right way of thinking that depressed me (having been raised on patriarchal interpretation of art and culture) which in itself was based on denying my sexuality and ancestral knowledge about it. So the way some people throw medication at you or tell you it is \u201ca physical illness\u201d then goes on top of those worries that \u201cthere might be something wrong with you\u201d (I did resist this idea, nevertheless) because you are intelligent and question things. It has been much, much better since my going vegan, because of the ethics involved - suddenly the anxiety just disappeared because there was no more hiding the lies I\u2019d been participating in. The depression still returns at times, but it is good to know it\u2019s an ongoing balance to be free of it, not a destination. Meaning that \u201cthe dark\u201d always compensates for something \u2014 we must remember to embrace it and the loneliness we run away from, because that is why we experience them as negative.",

				"It takes a lot of courage to talk about issues that are so personal and I completely understand how you are feeling.  I too have struggled with depression all my life and when I was younger, I went to many therapists trying to get help. The last one I went to tried hypnotherapy with me and when he saw that it was not helping, he suggested that I try an antidepressant. I am not a fan of taking medications but he said something to me that made me reconsider. He said \"if you were a diabetic, would you refuse to take medication for your illness? Depression is a physical illness and if medication can help then you should give it a chance\". I did and it changed my life. The first pill he prescribed did nothing for me. The second kicked in after about 6 weeks and since them, I feel so much better. No more suicidal thoughts, no more feelings of lack of self-worth. I am not saying that it would be right for everyone, but it sure helped me. You might want to talk to your therapist about it. Best of luck to you and thank you for sharing your struggles. It always helps to know that you are not alone.",

				"Oh my goodness, only 40. As far as I\u2019m concerned you are ahead of the game. I\u2019m 49 and feel like I\u2019m just getting my baggage sorted. A wise therapist once pointed out to me that demonizing our past behaviors is not nearly as helpful as Honoring and appreciating them for getting us to where we are so we can then release them as they no longer serve us. I hope this might help you in your journey. Love and light to you.",
				"Hello Ania, I follow you and love your recipes. I've read your story and feel compel to share. I follow Dr. Joe Dispenza who was a chiropractor who broke his spine quite a few years ago now but healed. I know it sounds crazy. Anyway he now teaches workshops over the world, has written a couple of books, Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, and Becoming Supernatural and another Evolving Your Brain. It's basically guided meditations with changing your thoughts and feelings during the day. It's a lot to say in a message, but two nights ago I was watching some testimonials as they really keep me inspired (I am healing from an autoimmune issue). Here is the link to this lady Amy and it's a beautiful journey but obviously didn't start out that way. Maybe it will resonate with you.

I think having bananas in the batter makes for a great consistency, and mixing banana with the soda and acid (I chose apple cider vinegar) meant that the soda was well dissolved for sure! Great pancakes :)",

I added a tiny bit of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to give them some extra flavor, but they\u2019re super tasty without that too! This will definitely be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.",

				"9. Flatten a piece of ganache in your hands and then quickly roll a blob of peanut butter (it should be firm but still malleable when ready). Place the peanut butter ball in the middle of the ganache and close the ganache around it. Roll quickly in your hands to form a compact ball and then in the chopped peanuts to coat. Continue in the same manner until you finish the batch, then place the truffles in the fridge while you make another 5 truffles. Working in small batches is a good idea as the mixture will get messier to work with the longer it sits around.",
				"10. Store in an airtight container, in the fridge. These truffles should keep for 3-4 days."

					"PASTRY": [
						"1. Put flour, icing sugar and xanthan gum (if making GF pastry) into a large bowl. If using maple syrup instead of icing sugar, add it to the water at the very end.",
						"2. Add the salt and chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour with two knifes until no large lumps remain \u2013 to check, shake the bowl lightly, they will come to the surface. See my earlier post for photos of this process.",
						"3. Once the mixture is uniform and there are no large lumps left, rub the small bits of oil into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left. Yes, I know, it does take some time!\nFinally add in some ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with two cutlery knives. Add water very gradually as it\u2019s key not to add more than necessary for the dough to come together. I found that about 35 ml / 2 tbsp + 1 tsp of water is needed in total. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.\nOnce the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in a vegan food wrap or cling film and chill for 30-60 minutes.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and cut it into 4 portions. Roll each portion out on a lightly floured surface until it\u2019s about 2-3 mm in thickness.\nPlace the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife or by rolling a rolling pin along the baking case edge. Patch any holes up with the cut off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.\nContinue in the same manner with the remaining three pieces of pastry.\nPierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 30 minutes while you preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.\nLine the pastry cases with square pieces of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.\nBlind bake the pastry for 15 minutes.

						"1. After the pastry has cooled off, spoon raspberry filling (about 4 tsp per tart) into each pastry shell. If using chia/flax jam option, you may want to brush a bit of melted chocolate at the bottom of each tart and allow it to set before spooning the jam in \u2013 this will create a moisture proof barrier and prevent the pastry from getting soggy.",

The raspberry dark chocolate combo is perfect, nice flaky dough and just the right balance between tart and sweet taste. I used vegan butter instead of coconut oil and chia seeds for the raspberry filling.  Chia seeds gave a very nice and fluffy texture to the raspberry filling. Thank you and Happy Valentine's Day,  Ania!",

You can use a baking tray, but not one that gets misshapen in high heat or else all the juices will run to one corner and burn (I know from experience \ud83d\ude1b ).",

				"From not being a mushroom fan to this recipe and the mushroom ragu being firm favourites! Delicious.",
				"This pasta is absolutely fantastic. I make it about once a week now! I like to add caramelized onions to the saut\u00e9ed garlic. So tasty and easy to make.",
				"Wow - this has to be one of the tastiest vegan pasta recipes I\u2019ve ever come across. Not only is it delicious, it\u2019s totally easy and I had all of the ingredients at home anyway. It was creamy, full of flavour and very moreish. I\u2019ll be cooking and craving this regularly. Thank you so much.. I\u2019m a huge fan of your Blog and Instagram account  \u263a\ufe0f",
				"This is ridiculously good. So easy and quick and you get so much flavor",
				"This was delicious, I doubled the recipe for my family!!! The sauce is so rich and yummy, and it was so filling. In hindsight, I think it would have been best to mix the  nutritional yeast and the pasta water before adding to the  frying pan, since my pan was too hot, and the water evaporated before they could really form a paste. I'm definitely making this again holy macaroni.",
				"Made this last night and it was delicious! Luckily made enough to have leftovers for lunch today! Yummy! Thanks xx",
				"Made this for dinner tonight. So yummy!",
				"I made this dish last night and it came out amazing. very easy and my husband just loved it. Thank you for sharing.",
				"This is fast becoming my favourite pasta recipe. Thank you so much!",
				"Amazing! I used some parmesan insetad of nutritional yeast as I am not vegan. Great recipe!",
				"Made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I sauteed some spinach to mix in too. :D",
				"Really enjoyed this recipe, had to modify it slightly as didn't have maple syrup so used carob syrup instead and added a few extra vegetables - it was delicious and love that it is simple to follow. Thank you.",
				"Made this deliciousness last night and even our picky 5-year-old was a fan! We used a spinach pasta, but otherwise made the dish according to the recipe. It's wonderful. In the future, I think I will slice the mushrooms a little thicker as they do get quite baked during the process, but that's just a personal preference. Thank you so much for a great meal!",
				"What can I use instead of nutritional yeast? I'm not vegan.",
				"I made this and it was reely good just tinkk the mushrooms should be a little thicker. I will be making this again",
				"Hi Ania, thanks for this easy and flavourfull recipe. Made it tonight and I really liked it!",
				"Would love to make this.  Sounds great.  Can you double the recipe?",
				"Discovered this recipe by chance but will be back for more - it\u2019s delicious. Had no balsamic vinegar So used balsamic glaze instead and omitted the maple syrup and the sticky consistency worked really well. I also added sliced courgettes in with the garlic fry as I don\u2019t like nutri-yeast/cheesy tastes and  the result was fab. Thank you LazyCatKitchen!",
				"Cooked this last week, easy to cook and absolutely  delicious. Already a firm favourite.",
				"Hi!  Can you please share the brand of balsamic vinegar you used?  I can\u2019t seem to find a good brand.  Thank you.",
				"I made this (kind of!) tonight but with shiitake mushrooms, conchiglie and I added 50g of soya mince as I was hungry! It's delicious and the flavours really come out through the oven then pan cooking. Definitely one to have again. Thanks for posting this, Ania!",
				"I made this balsamic mushroom tonight and, wow, this is good! Such a rich sauce and absolutely packed with flavour. I only used 1 garlic clove in the marinade and did all the mushroom and sauce cookery in a frying pan (because we don't have an oven). A deceptively easy recipe which would be great as a dinner party showoff dish!",
				"This was absolutely delicious!",
				"Carrefour, cost an arm and a leg but that\u2019s the usual. It\u2019s very smokey and thick so maybe the maple syrup would need to be reduced so it\u2019s not too sweet. \ud83d\ude18",
				"I made this tonight. It was so easy and delicious!! I used 2 Tbsp of California Balsamic Garlic. I accidentally put in 1 Tbsp of maple syrup. I also subbed coconut aminos for the soy. I think the recipe is quite forgiving. Next time I might try adding some additional vegetables too. Yum!",
				"Hello my lovelies, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better \ud83d\ude18This dish is lush as I love pasta and mushrooms and it\u2019s easy to make unlike the cakes I used to be force fed from my neighbours \ud83d\ude1d. Have you tried mushrooms and pasta with \u2018black\u2019 garlic? It\u2019s a game changer and a new fav of mine. Missing you \ud83d\ude18",
				"I really like your recipes but I have a secret.. I am not vegan or vegetarian..however I really like to eat healthier!  Would really love to make this one but in Greece you can\u2019t find  nutritional yeast so easy.. so what would you recommend to do? Thanks again for the inspiration!! Ps you will love Lindy Hop!!!! I also took some lessons and I have to say I felt so young and full of joy!! Maybe it\u2019s the music..",
				"Softish on the gums too \ud83d\ude09. Hope braces are settling in.. not funny being sick and having a sore mouth!  Recipe looks and sounds delicious \ud83d\ude0b",

I have insulin resistance, so I can't each sugary foods... but I still love a fluffy muffin now and again.So, I switched the bananas for baked sweet potatoes and the maple syrup for a 50-50 mix of water and a vanilla protein mix. I also used green buckwheat and oat flour as my gf flour. The result was a moist but fluffy, perfectly, cinnamony winter comfort-food. Thank you Ania!",

				"Loved making and eating these today, Ania - thank you! It's taken me ages to do any vegan baking after a few 'gluey' and rubbery attempts early on in my vegan journey, but having now made these and also your chocolate muffins, which were also excellent, and Nigella's sumptuous chocolate cake successfully too, I'm feeling much more confident and happy to share the outcomes with non-vegan friends.",

				"This is one of my favourite pasta recipes whenever I am craving something very savoury and quick. I usually add some fresh lemon zest as well. Delicious! And a super quick meal. Thank you so much for this simple and tasty recipe, I have been making it a lot :) My teeth are very sensitive so when I got braces as an adult a few years back it was a nightmare. Food is my main hobby and just like you wrote above, from one day to the next, food became a painful chore. And meal preparation was not about taste or cravings anymore but about \"what can I cook today that is so soft that I can crush it with my tongue but still nutritious\". It has been a year since this post so I really hope that it has gotten easier for you or that you might even be rid of your braces by now :)",

I had the wide rice noodles on hand so that\u2019s what we used and we don\u2019t cook with oils so we just added some chopped olives along with the capers. Amazing! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.",

I check-in to your site almost every day and I am delighted when I see a picture of a dish I hadn't seen before.

I don't have a food processor, but I did okay with a stiff wire whisk and a glass bowl, just making a mash. It probably had a bit more texture than the processed paste, but it worked.With the leftover tahini (it doesn't seem to come in small containers) I made a healthy tahini hummus and a not-so-healthy halva.",
				"Hi AniaThis is a great recipe, thanks for sharing. I just tried doing it now, but the chocolate topping seemed too liquid, so not sure if the mixture will settle completely on the top of the bar. Maybe I should put less coconut oil next time?  What do you think might have gone wrong? Many thanks!",
				"This is so good! I like the idea that there is no sugar. Then I also used dates for the chocolate topping. Actually I try as much as I can to bake without sugar and dates are a good alternative.

It\u2019s not necessary though, you can also just use raw potatoes but they produce crispier hash browns with less softness inside. I\u2019ve included both options below.",
				"2. Grate raw or cooled parboiled potatoes coarsely in a food processor or using a manual grater.",
				"3. Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F (no fan) for raw potato hash browns and 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F for par-boiled potato ones. Get a non-stick baking sheet and a round cookie cutter or an egg ring (mine was 8 cm / 3\u2033 diameter) ready.",
				"4. Place grated potatoes and remaining ingredients in a bowl. If using raw potatoes, set the mixture aside for 10 minutes. If using parboiled potatoes, there is no need to do that and skip the next step too!",
				"5. After 10 minutes, place the raw potato mixture in the middle of a clean muslin cloth or kitchen towel and squeeze all the excess moisture out. Drain the water away and you will end up with potato starch stuck to the bottom of the bowl \u2013 it is the starch that makes for crispy hash browns so scoop it up and add it back to the mixture. Break compacted mixture up with a fork or your hands after squeezing the liquid out.",
				"6. Using a brush or an oil spray, spread a bit of oil underneath each hash brown, place a cookie cutter on the oiled area and loosely pile the mixture inside the cookie cutter (to just under 1 cm / 0.35 \u201d height), but DON\u2019T COMPACT the mixture. Use a fork to ensure the mixture is spread fairly evenly and it goes all the way to the edges \u2013 make sure the mixture is piled up loosely \u2013 this way it will cook all the way through and the hash browns won\u2019t be tough. If you would rather freestyle, that\u2019s fine too \u2013 use a spoon, don\u2019t flatten the mixture too much and tidy the edges up with a knife to avoid them getting burnt.",
				"7. Bake the raw potato hash browns for 20 minutes and parboil ones for about 10 then carefully detach from the tray using a flat spatula. Brush the surface of the baking tray with oil again and flip each hash brown making sure that it sits directly on the oiled patch. Bake for a further 15-20 minutes (raw potato hash browns) and 10-15 minutes (parboiled potato hash browns).",
				"8. Serve straight away with vegan sour cream/creme fraiche or ketchup \u2013 whichever takes your fancy."

				"Great recipe!",
				"Amazing recipe, a little taste of Seoul. I used tofu instead of tempeh and it worked. Thanks!",
				"Absolutely delicious! I forgot to bake the tempeh before adding it to the marinade, so ended up baking it a big longer at the end. It was nonetheless a success; we loved the texture and combination of flavours. The coleslaw also accompany this meal perfectly. Thank you Ania!",

I didn\u2019t have seasoned rice vinegar, so I subbed it for apple cider, and it worked just fine. The slaw would make a lovely side all on its own. Thank you for another great vegan recipe.

				"My take on this recipe turned out great!  I'm in the US and couldn't find smoked tofu, so I substituted TVP [I used a half cup dry] with a few added spices [tamari, liquid smoke, blackstrap molasses, ground fennel, and nutritional yeast], though the additional spices shouldn't be strictly necessary.  I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry, which is accidentally vegan.  Even the non-vegans quite enjoyed them.",
				"Total winner of a recipe! I'm calling these \"Self-saucing sausage rolls\" as they were so moist and tasty I didn't need ketchup, and I am usually a ketchup fiend when it comes to these things.I made this with half white rice, half tofu (cos I had 1/2 cup of cooked rice in the fridge needing using up) and it worked a charm. I used nearly 3 large portobello mushrooms (which came to 250g - wow they're heavy!)I was worried the garlic would burn while I fried the mushrooms so I added it in just as soon as the water had come out of the mushrooms (assuming they will start to absorb flavours around  at this point)",

				"These are the most delicious vegan sausage rolls I've ever had. Wouldn't change a thing about them. Thanks for the recipe.",
				"These are so delicious! I made the rice version and the mix itself was super tasty, I could have eaten a lot of that by itself. I wasn't sure when to add the paprika, but added it with the worcestershire sauce/soy sauce etc. mix, hope that was right!The rolls made a lovely dinner with roast potatoes and veg, and we were able to resist eating the lot, so we now have a perfect lunch addition or snack. I may make these for dinner parties/potlucks. Thanks for the recipe, it has definitely lightened our lockdown :)",

Place the sheet of pastry in front of you so that the longer edge runs parallel to the work bench (I used a Jus Roll puff pastry sheet, which measures 23 cm / 9\u2033 by 35 cm / 13.5\u2033 cm). You will place your filling in the horizontal middle of the pastry. The width of the area designated for the filling is determined by the width of your butternut squash (mine was 8 cm / 3\u2033 wide).",
						"2. Mould some of the filling in a rectangle.",
						"3. Place the two halves of the butternut squash on top of the filling so that the cut ends touch each other in the centre \u2013 you may need to trim them so that they aren\u2019t longer than the filling area.",
						"4. Mould the rest of the filling over the butternut squash using your hands, making sure you compact the filling as you go along.",
						"5. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm / 1\u2033 diagonal incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack to be able to create a braid at the top. See photos and video under this post for more details.",
						"6. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. This method works great here as it prevents slack in the pastry and allows for tight wrapping despite the slightly irregular shape of the filling. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevents the vegetarian Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"7. Brush the pastry with soy milk.",
						"8. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden. Serve with gravy and your favourite sides."

						"4. Form the dough into a ball, grease it lightly and place it on plate. Cover it with an upside down bowl rinsed with hot boiling water. Rest the dough for about 30 minutes and move onto the filling (see below).",
						"5. Just before you are ready to roll out the dough, preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F. Line a large baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"6. Once the dough has rested and the filling is ready, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface.",

The thinner the dough the better but if you are a beginner, don\u2019t worry, do the best you can! If you get any small tears, patch them up quickly.",

						"9. Decide where your filling is going to go, taking into account the size of your baking tray. Designate the area for the filling leaving a wide margin alongside the filling so that you could cover the filling with it and a smaller margin at both ends. Pile the filling in the designated area making sure that it is compact and even.",

				"Such a delicious flavour these cookies were!! Some of them did turn our quite soft, but I sandwiched the batch in twos with choc ganache, and drizzled them on top as well ... the flavour with adding orange oil, Vanilla extract, hazelnuts was superb \ud83d\udc4c",
				"Wow!!! Definitely for keeps. Thanks sooo much",
				"I made these for a Christmas party in Hong Kong, for a group from all over Asia, Europe, Africa and N. America, and everyone loved them! I added unsweetened coconut flakes to the almond mix and it worked brilliantly with the other flavors. The \u201ccaramel\u201d of maple syrup, almond butter, and coconut cream is dangerously divine... I\u2019m already brainstorming of how to use this in other recipes!  I found that after baking in the individual cups, placing them in the freezer helped them to set, and the leftovers in the freezer still taste great a week later. Thanks, Ania, for sharing your creative talents with the world!",
				"Me and my non-vegan family loved these. They all went first despite there being plenty of different cookies in our traditional Xmas cookie tin and everyone kept on asking me to make more. Thank you for sharing!",
				"Hi, I made these last year, and I think the receipt called for candied orange? Have you changed it ? Or have I mixed up with another receipt??Still going to make them again \ud83d\ude0a",
				"I tried this recipe today, followed instructions carefully, but my florentines are still not set, two hours after coming out of the oven! I can''t remove them from the paper cases because they are too soft, and yes, I did grease the cases first.",
				"Hi, these sound delicous and I will be making them this Christmas. I will be using muffin cups. My question is do you take the florentines out of the cups and then coat in chocolate or do you coat the top of the florentines once they are in the cups? I was thinking of serving them in the cupThanks x",
				"Delicious \ud83c\udf1f",
				"OMG these Florentines are just lush! Perfect, amazing, stunning  -  At least I think so, husband not so sure , needs another batch to  sample, just  to check\u2026..",
				"Hello Ania,I\u2019m looking forward to trying these florentine\u2019s for my mums birthday next week - they look amazing. I\u2019m really sorry how this country, it\u2019s government and its ill-educated prejudiced people have made you feel. I am ashamed to be British. My partner and I have had enough of paying our taxes to this right-wing government whose values are totally misaligned with ours, thus, we are hoping to move to NZ. Whatever you choose/ have chosen to do, I wish you all the best and hope you are happy. There are many Brits like us who are on your side but I bet it\u2019s hard to remember that. Best wishes,Meryl",
				"So yummy! Was easy to make, tasted amazing and pretty healthy ingredients. Loved it :)",
				"Hi Ania,Just made these, and they are GREAT!!! Added dried apricots,  some hazelnuts, and rice malt syrup instead of maple syrup....Thank you so much for this recipe, and wish you Happy Christmas! Xx",
				"Excellent idea placing them in the muffin pan. They do spread otherwise and I spend a lot of time shaping them with a cutter. I have tried making a drier mix but it just ends up becoming a different biscuit. Thanks for the tip.",
				"Hello there,How long do these last? Thinking of making as Christmas pressie!",
				"For your florentines you state \u2018no fan\u2019. My oven is a fan oven it affect cooking process.",
				"They're delicious, but how do ypu keep the bottom from sticking to the paper cups?  :(  Thanks for any tips!",
				"I'm just making these, inspired by last week's bake off, I can't wait!! Also reading your article and as a British citizen, I fully understand your woes with our current government, who would have thought things would get even worse this year, but they only seem to be using Covid to force through an even more extreme version of Brexit!!!!",
				"Do you think banana chips would work instead of the raisins? It will be quite different, but I guess I'm wondering if you think they will burn?",
				"Could I use coconut yoghurt instead of the coconut cream? (It's been sitting in the fridge and needs using up!)",
				"One word: AMAZING!! They taste perfect!  So much better than the one bought in stores! Thank you so much for all your recipes, I love them!",
				"Ania...Waiting for the Waitrose ginger to arrive, I think will be worth the wait.  I realize that it is an option but I want to make it the way you do.  You were very clear in your reply that I could have used fresh ginger or candied ginger but still, I want to do it your way!When I finally receive the special jar of ginger and make the cookies, I will let you know how they turned out. Thank you for all your recipes, keep up to good work!",
				"Thanks for the heads up.   I live in California, USA,  so I went online and found that \u201cAmazon.com\u201d has  Waitrose Cook\u2019s plump & spicy stem ginger in syrup. 350 grams.  It will take about 4 weeks to receive it.  Can\u2019t wait to make the cookies, with all the yummy ingredients the cookie should be delicious.",
				"Marvellous, thank you.",
				"Question...In the ingredients list for the Vegan Florentines you ask for 1.75 stem of ginger in syrup, where do you find that?  Will fresh ginger do? Or candied ginger?",
				"These look amazing! Just want to check: do you just throw in the flax seed dry? (i.e. you don't make a \"flaxseed egg\"?) I'm making these this week - looking forward! Thank you for your great recipes!",
				"Thanks for this, and all your other great recipes!  I am so sorry about the way in which the current political climate is affecting you - you could always consider a move to Scotland, you are welcome here!",
				"Hello Ania,When do you remove the paper muffin cups?  I made these and they have been cooling for about an hour but are still very fragile.  I have not yet added the chocolate.  Maybe that will help?",
				"I can't wait to make these as Christmas presents for people - they look amazing!And I want to add to everyone else's comments re how unwelcome you now feel with Brexit and the election - I'm so sorry. As others have said, many of us are heartbroken that this is how people now feel in this country. The government, the PM and indeed the referendum don't speak for all of us. I'm sorry.",
				"Just  did them. Yacks. Didn\u2019t work for me. Not sticking together. No flour??.",
				"They look scrumptious! My vegan son and daughter-in-law are coming from NY to visit for Christmas. Can I make these ahead of time and freeze them?Or how long can I  store them in the refrigerator? Thank you so much!",
				"Ania. Your blog is wonderful with terrific recipes and food. Well done for doing this week after week for such a long time now...I live in Scotland where it looks like we will reject the UK Tories hateful and hate-filled politics. So many of us fully welcome people from the EU. Hope you can find a way forward, and if you can stand the weather, come and join us here - where veganism is booming too! CxxLove those other two immigrants too! Duncan and Tina.",
				"Could we maybe substitute maple syrup with honey?Thnx, xx",
				"I LOVE EVERYTHING  you make \u2764  I recommend your page all the time, thank you for all the amazing food you share \ud83d\ude0a\u2764I feel strongly for you and with you. Being German and having made my life here it is upsetting to see how many people jump on the band wagon, including friends, albeit with the 'oh we don't mean YOU' justification.  I do not think anyone can understand how 'we' feel, it is so sad there IS an US and THEM and it's discernable in everyday life. My own father in law is adamant that voting out was the right thing  and he does not really listen when I try to explain.  I felt truly at home before this fateful vote and now, despite being married to a Brit (which is apparently the solution to any issue) and having teo boys I feel like I cannot settle whilst this whole thing is ongoing...  I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're NOT alone and there's good, kind people out there who love our diversity and support us.  Much love \u2764",
				"So sorry to hear that the dreadful political situation is making you feel unwanted here.  We are hoping that the current government are not successful today and we can continue to be part of a united country where everyone is welcomed and valued.  Please don\u2019t leave x",
				"These look delish \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m going to try making these next week when I have a couple of days leave,  in the meantime they\u2019re pinned on my Christmas food and drink board!I\u2019m equally sorry to hear  how our  buffoon of a prime minister made you feel ! I\u2019m of second generation Polish descent, and very proud of my heritage....we\u2019re all immigrants in reality. I voted remain and hope to god the Conservatives don\u2019t get in again today!! Stay  strong x",
				"Hi.  I can't have coconut. Is the purpose of the coconut cream jsut to give this more of a milk chocolate taste?  Can u do without it? Maybe stir in some more almond butter or rice flour? With the latter, that's wnat4ivd noticed companies do with the alternative to milk chocolate.... They add rice flour to chocolate. Thank you!",
				"Well firstly, I love Florentines, but for some reason it has never occurred to me to make vegan ones.  Secondly your photos are ACTUALLY  making me drool (altho I'm fasting for a blood test this am so it was probably not a good time to look at recipes!).  So I will be making these!Thirdly - my sympathies about the election/Brexit in UK. As I write there's still a chance you won't get Johnson  back in. But I understand your fears. We migrated to Australia 25 years ago and have never been more relieved to be not living in Britain. Friends have been getting some hope by canvassing madly, and at least you don't feel so helpless.Good luck, and if all else fails, eat a plate of Florentines with a nice pot of tea!!",
				"Wow I didn\u2019t hear Boris\u2019s comments and I am very sorry if he upset you. Please don\u2019t leave the uk.  We LOVE you living here.. Delicious recipe - thank you.",
				"They look delicious. Is there anything I can use instead of the coconut cream?"

				"3. Stir wet ingredients into the dry ones until loosely combined, then knead the dough gently together.",
				"4. Divide the dough in half and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.",
				"5. Before you are about to take the dough out of the fridge, set the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F and line two baking trays with a piece of baking paper.",
				"6. After resting, take the first portion of the dough out of the fridge. Give it a few minutes to bring it to room temperature. Roll it out (gently pressing with a rolling pin) on a lightly floured surface. For softer gingerbread cookies. roll the dough out quite thick (about 5 mm / 0.2\u2033) and cut the cookies out of it with cookie cutters. If you want the cookies to be crunchy, roll them out a bit thinner and bake them for longer.",
				"7. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking trays. You don\u2019t need to leave a lot of space between them as they don\u2019t expand much. Group similar size cookies together so that they cook in the same time. Bake small cookies for about 7-8 minutes and larger for 9-10 minutes. The longer you bake them for the crispier (and less soft and chewy) they will turn out, so adjust the baking time to your preference.",
				"8. To make the icing, mix icing sugar with a very small amount of water (about 1 tbsp) until you obtain a thick sugar paste.",
				"9. Place your icing into a small plastic or pastry bag. Push it all into one corner and cut a tiny bit off that corner with a pair of scissors. Start with a small hole and make it bigger if necessary. Apply the icing by squeezing the icing through the hole. Allow the icing to solidify before piling the biscuits on a plate or storing them in a box."

				"I've been making vegan gingerbread for roughly 20 years, as long as I've been vegan, and there was always something weird or wrong with the recipes, but this one was absolutely perfect. Everyone loved it - thank you and happy holidays from the U.S.!",
				"This cookies were so easy to make and also the dough was really easy to work with. I love the texture of soft and chewiness! I will be making this few more times at least this winter :) Thank you for great recipe as always. x",
				"These gingerbread cookies were incredible! They were super easy to make and came out with the perfect texture. I gave them to a couple of very picky kids and even the two-year-old liked them ( I used the full amount of sugar). The adults (myself included) loved them too! In the past I used a different recipe, but found that the other cookies always came out too hard. This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on! My compliments and thanks to the genius chef!!",
				"Hi! I just made this and they are sooooooo soft, I love them! :)",
				"Ah ok, so it\u2019s to replace fat rather than sugar? In that case I may try smooth nut butter and see how it affects flavour",
				"Hi Ania, I make a lot of your recipes and they always turn out really well!I want to make these but wondered about skipping applesauce - would you recommend a substitute?",
				"Lovely cookies, tasted awesome and went down a treat in our house!  Nice simple recipe  which came out just as expected.",
				"Thanks for the recipe. What can I use instead of maple syrup?",
				"Best gingerbread we\u2019ve made\u2014baked with my daughter this afternoon. We didn\u2019t have applesauce, so I used some pur\u00e9ed pineapple, and used extra virgin olive oil instead of coconut. Really delicious :) Thanks and merry Xmas from Australia.",
				"Thanks for this recipe, we loved the soft, gently spiced cookies and they were very popular with children and staff at school too - the recipe made enough for everybody! :)",
				"Hi Ania, how well / how long do these keep? Do they need to be refrigerated afterwards? I want to know how far in advance I can make them to give as gifts.",

				"These are absolutely delicious! At first I wasn't sure about the consistency,  but after keeping the dough in the fridge for a little while, it solidified and  the cookies came out perfect. Dziekuje za przepis Aniu!",
				"Lovely cookies!  I like the mottled Moggie the best \u263a\ufe0f  We feel the same about the mindless Xmas  consumerism but I think it\u2019s changing for many people. The shops have been suffering here for some years and people either choose not to gift, give charity gifts in lieu, buy at op shops  or have a very low cost ceiling and the gift has to be second hand. We haven\u2019t given gifts for three years and it certainly takes the stress out of it. The times they are, a slowly!, changing. Too slowly remains to be seen.Will you be taking a sabbatical while in Poland? I\u2019m sure all your followers would love to think you were having a break. Perhaps post a few Polish pics in lieu if feel have to do something. Xx",

				"9. Keep on adding the stock, in small amounts, until fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next portion. Make sure to stir the rice often to activate the starch, which makes for a creamy risotto.

Add a finely grated garlic clove, thyme leaves and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Stir well, allowing the garlic to cook gently in the mushrooms.\nKeep on adding the stock to the rice until the rice is almost al dente \u2013 i.e. has a small amount of bite to it when tasted. It will take about 15-20 minutes from the moment you first started adding liquid to the pan.\nTaste a grain of rice to make sure it is almost ready. If it is, stir some porcini cream (if using) and a bit of balsamic vinegar if you like a touch of acidity to break through the creaminess. Switch the heat off, cover the pan / pot and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes.\nDivide the risotto between bowls, top with pan-fried mushrooms and fresh parsley.",

				"Loved this recipe! I mixed half of the mushrooms into the risotto and had the rest on top, which I think was great. I have to say I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding the rehydrated mushrooms into the risotto just because mine were quite gritty and it\u2019s not that pleasant to eat when you get some in a mouthful. The rest is delicious though and would definitely recommend making the porcini cream as it adds soooo much!",
				"This is my 4th time cooking your beautiful risotto. My boyfriend says this risotto is restaurant quality!  Thank you x",
				"Sounds delicious! Can\u2019t wait to make this but thought I\u2019d best check as The recipe says 40g of dried mushrooms but in the method it says use 20g for mushrooms/cashew cream? Do I add the other 20g in with the fresh mushrooms?  Thanks",
				"Hi Ania.  Made this last night.   It was absolutely delicious.  I kept going back into the kitchen to get another spoonful .   I did not have any dried porcinis unfortunately so just had to rely on my  veggie broth and white wine.  I did use a splash of lemon juice instead of balsamic.  It still tasted  wonderful.   I will make it again but will make sure I have the dried porcinis as I think that will add a whole different dimension to the dish.  Thanks for your wonderful  recipes.  I am making your potato gratin this weekend - cannot wait to dig into that.",
				"Thanks Ania, another delicious dish. I confess that I had never made risotto before so I was a bit worried about this (do I need to boil the rice first? What do I do with the mushrooms from the stock? ...etc.), but  in the end it came together beautifully. Not quite as beautifully as your pictures, but still very tasty. It was a lot creamier than I thought it would be, the cashew/mushroom cream addition is inspired!Thanks for another great dish!",

					"PASTRY": [
						"1. Mix the flour, salt and xantham gum (if using a gluten-free flour mix instead of an all purpose flour containing gluten) in a large bowl or a food processor.",
						"2. Add chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour using a pastry cutter (or two knives) or pulse in a food processor until you obtain a sandy texture that clumps together when you grab a handful, with no large lumps of fat left. To check for large lumps, shake the bowl or the food processor bowl \u2013 it will bring large bits of oil to the surface.",
						"3. While you can do this step in the food processor, I strongly suggest you transfer the mixture to a large bowl at this point and do this manually as then you have a greater amount of control. Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using \u00bc cup plus 2 tsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flours have different absorbency levels.",
						"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc and refrigerate for at least 30-45 minutes.",
						"5. Gently and slowly roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.",
						"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm / 1 inch bigger than the pie dish (I used a 24 cm / 9.5\u2033 diameter pie dish). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the pie dish and unroll it gently. Line the dish and fold any excess you get at the edges under so that you end up with thick edges. Then go over the edge and crimp the edges by interlocking your index and middle finger on one hand against the index finger of your other hand (see photo). Pierce the bottom in several places with a fork.",
						"7. Heat up the oven to 160\u00b0 C / 320\u00b0 F fan forced (180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F no fan) and place your pie in the freezer (or fridge, but freezer is better) for another 15 minutes or so.",
						"8. Remove the pie dish from the freezer, place a piece of baking paper (scrunch it up first to make it more flexible) at the bottom of the dish and fill with baking beads (or dry beans). Blind bake for 10-15 minutes.",
						"9. Carefully remove the beads and the baking paper insert and return the pie to the oven for another 10 minutes. Remove it from the oven and set aside while you make your filling."

				"The perfect recipe to use up pumpkin! So delicious! I used some of the pumpkin from when we were carving them at Halloween so that it wasn't wasted (and gave me an excuse to make this yummy recipe all in the name of saving food waste!)",
				"I'm not that keen on tofu, so instead I used blended millet (pre-cooked in oat milk with all the spices). It was absolutely delicious, and a nutty butter is a really nice addition to the flavour.",
				"I made this for Christmas Day - it was my first time using silken tofu for a dessert which was exciting! I was surprised how custard like it was! It was perfect! I had a lot of trouble with the pastry though. When I refrigerated it, it just broke in pieces when I tried to roll it out. It seemed much better once I kneaded it all together again and when it was warmer but then of course it was very soft and difficult to put in the flan pan. I also blind baked it a lot longer than the recipe called for, but it still had a slightly gummy texture in the base, which I didn\u2019t like so not sure what I did there.But overall it was really tasty and I was inpressed! I will definitely be saving the recipe for future use \ud83d\ude00",
				"Oh I am so excited to try this recipe! I knew I had seen it somewhere made with silken tofu!  All others seem to use coconut cream and cashews or chickpeas and I just wasn\u2019t keen on that. I haven\u2019t heard of \u2018firm\u2019 silken tofu! Could it just simply be called silken tofu here? And how much pumpkins will I need to steam to equal to the amount in your recipe as I don\u2019t want to and can\u2019t use canned stuff here \ud83d\ude00",

I'm thinking soft shortbread...delicious, tasty and scrumptious!!  I would never have thought of making pastry with Coconut oil even though it's a staple in my kitchen. I have shared it on a vegan sirte that I belong to so I hope that is OK with you.  Absolutely the BEST pastry I have ever made or eaten!! Thank you so much for your kind sharing.....The pumpkin part was lovely too by the way ......",

				"Oh my god ! I love love these cookies! They are so easy to make and  only with ingredients you already have at home. Also these are the first vegan cookies that turned out well. I really love your baking recipes :)",
				"Yet another great recipe, thanks for sharing, perfect little treat with a cup of tea working from home!",
				"Thanks. Tasty. Tried them tonight before I had to give a talk. Ever so quick to make. Good use of the aquafaba in the fridge. Used salted peanut butter and no additional salt. Tried to speed and melt chocolate in the microwave but burnt the middle so I don't recommend that!! I used 2 large trays and they ended up looking like yours!",
				"Oh my goodness these were AMAZING.  My new favorite vegan cookie.  I didn't have almond flour so I subbed all purpose but only used 80grams instead of 100 so it would stay gooey and it worked fantastic.  My family all loved them.  We froze the extras and I think the best way to eat them is straight out of the freezer.  Oh and I used cashew butter intead of almond butter and it was fantastic.",
				"These were amazing! But mine didn\u2019t spread though and was wondering how did you achieve the flatten and lovely cracks in your cookies? \ud83d\ude0a thanks!",
				"Would aquafava leave any chickpea smell to the cookies? I have used aquafava to make chocolate cake and the smell was too strong even after baking. Otherwise these look great and I would definitely love to make These soon!",
				"Love these cookies. They are like a brownie in cookie form. I didn't have any  almond butter and used vegan chocolate spread instead.",
				"I'm not thur best bake in the world, made these but wondering if I've done something wrong? They still tasted nice but was a bit dry and they didn't flatten out.  Could it be 1) I didn't put quite enough aquafaba in, or 2) I didn't whisk it enough?   Also does it matter if I use smooth or crunchy nut butter?  Many thanks",
				"These are delicious and so chocolatey! I was a bit worried because I struggled to fold in the almond butter and ended up losing most of the volume of the aquafaba, but they came out perfectly with an amazing squidgy texture inside. They freeze and defrost well too. Thanks Ania!",
				"OMG these cookies are sooooo gooood..... and so easy to make. Thanks again for a great recipe....LiLo",
				"Hi, these look wonderful! Do I have to use almond flour or can I use a more conventional flour like plain flour?",
				"I made these and they're really nice. I had to make a chocolate bar to use for it as I had none in the house and to buy one would have taken me over budget this week - seemed kind of crazy, making the chocolate, setting it so that I could melt it again but I couldn't be sure what weight it would come out at!!!I was expecting them to spread so made the mistake of just leaving them in heaps on the baking tray - I'll know better next time!",
				"These cookies are the best cookies I\u2019ve ever tasted. Amazing! Thanks so much Ania for sharing this recipe.",
				"Hi, just wondering how long these will last how to store them? They look amazing!",
				"Do these taste almonds or does the chocolate cover it up?  Oh yes, builders are fun.",
				"Ania can I just use eggs instead of aquafaba as I don\u2019t have any ready and really wanted to make these cookies. If yes how many eggs? Thank you. P.S. Sorry about the experience you had to go through, some people are just not professional at all.",
				"These are hands down THE BEST chocolate cookies I EVER had! Like, seriously. Thank you so much",

I am terrible at making gluten-free treats although I have a close family member who is gluten free loves and treats as much as we all do :) so these were a Godsend really. They were so quick to make and everyone loved them. Only change I made was left out a bit of the sugar. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These cookies are perfection! Your recipes deliver EVERY TIME! Thank you!!",
				"Hi there these look delicious! Can I ask what the chickpea brine is for? And what can I use as an alternative if I don\u2019t have any on hand right now?",
				"Can you replace the aquafaba with another egg replacement? I cannot have the brine of legumes.",
				"It looks really great. Can I do this? I am not sure. Thanks.",
				"Sooooo goood",
				"Sorry Anya, I know how it feels when you come out of something feeling a little taken advantage of. It leaves a sour taste.Question: If I don't have a chocolate bar on hand, do you think I could make this using cocoa powder? If not, I'll just wait till Monday to go buy some good vegan choc. I live in Greece and I know you know how it is.... got to wait for the Bio store to open :D",
				"Sorry to read about your experience. I was shaking my head as I was reading about the way they treated you and your home. You still managed to bake these delicious looking cookies though?? Amazing!Any chance I can still use regular all-purpose flour to make them nut-free? Allergies! They won\u2019t have the same delicious taste as almond flour, but as long as I won\u2019t mess them up completely... Thank you and I hope all your construction-next-times are positive and uplifting :)"

				"Had this for dinner tonight! Easy, relatively quick and had great flavor. I never use oil so pan roasted onions did not work but saut\u00e9ing in good old water on the stovetop worked great. Oven baking the whole pieces of butternut saved me peeling time. After it cooked, just scooped out the squash. Everything ended up in my saut\u00e9 pan.  I added nutritional yeast and tahini for the finished dish served with sorghum pasta.  I found this recipe because I have surplus onions and just happened to also have a butternut in the bin. Thanks for such an inspiring recipe!",

				"I really don't know how you do it with these mixed pasta dish flavors. The nutritional yeast with the balsamic, the squash, the nuttiness from the whole wheat pasta...  it all comes together so nicely. I used baby spinach instead of kale, and mixed it in at the end until just wilted --delicious. This and the almond butter/pumpkin/miso pasta dish are both so unique and SO worth the effort. Thank you <3",
				"Tried this tonight and it was so yummy. I love making the caramelized onions on the same sheet pan as the squash.

						"1. Rinse the dried mushrooms well to get rid of any grit and place them in a small bowl. Cover with boiling water.",

						"6. Add the diced dry mushrooms to the pan, together with the chopped rosemary leaves, whole thyme sprigs, bay leaves, smoked paprika, nutmeg, chilli (if using) and 1 tsp of salt. Stir everything around for a minute or so.",
						"7. Add the mushroom stock, being careful not to tip over the grit that sometimes gathers at the bottom of the dish.",
						"8. After the mixture comes to a gentle simmer, add the wine and allow it to bubble gently for a few minutes so that the harsh taste of alcohol cooks out, for about 10 minutes.",
						"9. Grind your chickpeas in a food processor until their texture resembles mince. Be careful not to overprocess.",
						"10. Add both tomato cans and about 1 cup (240 ml) of water (I like to rinse my cans with it first).",

Put the lid on and allow the sauce to bubble on a low-medium heat until the tomatoes have broken down (about 30 minutes). If using raw, soaked chickpeas, throw them in now and allow them to cook in the sauce, topping up with extra water if the pan is starting to look dry. If using cooked chickpeas add them in at the very end.",
						"12. Once the tomatoes have broken down, take the lid off and start reducing the sauce on a low-medium heat. If the pan is starting to look a bit too dry, add another cup of water and cook until you achieve the desired consistency. Remember to give the sauce a good stir from time to time to ensure that the middle of the pan does not burn. Leave the \u2018mince\u2019 on a wetter side as it will lose some further moisture in the oven.",

				"Hi Ania, I made it recently and it was soon good! My daughter hates mushrooms in any way, so, I decided to try this recipe with half of the amount and chopped them really small. I skipped the red wine also bc of my daughter and used mushroom powder instead of the dried mushrooms, it's easier and quicker and as good.The idea with the minced chickpeas is great! We both liked your Shepherd's Pie so much and my daughter didn't know about the mushrooms, I didn't tell her, pssst.,. ; ) We heated up the remaining the next day and it was still good and delicious.Finally I have a recepy with mushrooms she will also eat because I love mushrooms! Thanks for this great recepy!",
				"Great recipe, thank you! My entire family enjoyed it and it wasn't difficult to make!",
				"Hi Ania! Love love love your recipes. What weight are you using for the cup measurement here, for the lentils? Thank youEloise",
				"Hi Ania! I actually wrote the calorie info intended for the other commenter (I tried to respond to her comment, but looks likeit just  appeared as a new comment) - anyone could figure out the calories with fitness pal if you don't have them on your site. <3",
				"You can easily calculate calories with www.myfitnesspal.com/recipe/calculator! I use it all the time. :)",
				"I've been vegan for over 30 years and have never used chickpeas like this as a replacement for what would traditionally be meat! It is BRILLIANT! I will use this sub in lots of other things now!! My version of this turned out so yummy! I despise mushrooms, so I left them out, altered to herbs to my taste (no nutmeg, no chili, and no sugar), subbed tomato sauce since I didn't have whole tomatoes, and added chopped kale and a layer of organic green peas on top before adding the mash. Also, to make this quick and lower cal, I used Bob's Red Mills potato flakes made with just water to make the mashed potatoes. IT IS SO GOOD and WILL BE A GOTO FROM NOW ON! Thank you!",
				"Any idea what the calorie count is please? Made this and it was yummy! Thank you",
				"This is excellent!I left out the red wine, used fresh tomatoes (peeled and chopped) instead of tinned (leaving out the date syrup/sugar, which I guess is there to balance the acidity of the tinned toms). I used brown lentils (Spanish, from a jar) instead of chickpeas. And I used plain mash, rather than the deluxe version given here, because I ran out of time.Result? Absolutely fabulous. I have several recipes for a vegetarian/vegan cottage pie - this is easily the best. Thanks Ania!",
				"I made this during the week and it was absolutely  delicious - went down a storm with my omni partner too! Thanks so much for sharing  \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Turned out surprisingly good! A bit time consuming though. I was honestly worried cause the sauce looked like some weird mess, but after it was baked everything settled into a neat and tasty dish. I skipped porcini and substituted red wine with white. Made potato mash with the water used to cook the potatoes (the best and most unpretentious way in my opinion; thanks granddad who taught me this trick) and vegan butter. Thank you for another great recipe!",
				"hi there!  this looks amazing - wondering if it could be made earlier in the day or night before and re-heated before serving?  let me know if that would work/any details around re-heating. :) thank you!",
				".4 of an ounce is such a tiny amount of mushrooms. Does it make much of a difference?",
				"Plan to make this at the weekend for the kids. They love the bolognese so I suspect this will go down a treat!FYI - ref painting; I had the same dilemma when painting our north facing front room. I braved the darkness and went for Farrow and Ball Hague Blue, and I'm so glad I did! It looks amazing and is super cosy at this time of year, especially when the wood burner is going! Wish I could upload a photo for you! :-)",
				"Shepherds Pie and Cottage Pie are not the same thing. Shepherds Pie is made with lamb (as in sheep / shepherd) while Cottage Pie  is made with beef. Not a distinction that vegans need trouble themselves about obviously! Nice recipe - I like the idea of the chestnuts in the mix.",

						"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, grab a portion of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be\u00a0about\u00a01-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough, the tastier the dumplings. With a cookie cutter or an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place a small amount of filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a damp kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough or the filling.",
						"3. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water is boiling, throw\u00a0in 10 dumplings at a time and from the moment the water comes to the boil again cook for 5 minutes (depending on how thick your dough is). Once the time is up, fish them out with a slotted spoon and place on a clean plate. Put a new batch in\u00a0until you have cooked\u00a0them all.",
						"4. OPTIONAL STEP: Heat up a little olive oil in a pan and place the cooled-down (they should be cold!) dumplings in the pan. Turn them after they\u2019ve browned on one side. Make sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan and do not turn the dumplings too early as they may start falling apart.",

						"2. Next add in garlic cloves and fry on a gentle heat for a few minutes, stirring the whole time.",

				"What the f is all the bullshit about. Everyone is here for the recipe. Stop journaling",
				"So tasty!! This recipe is perfect for a beginner with time on their hands. I didn't have dried mushroom, so I just substituted about a quart of vegan no-beef broth.",
				"made these a while ago. it took so much effort to be honest, but was totally worth it, the guests were impressed! and the pierogi tasted amazing after being frozen for a few weeks. i recommend rolling the dough as thin as possible, as stated in the recipe :) thank you so much, I'll definitely make them again",
				"Worked perfectly. Did half the recipe which would serve 3-4 for dinner. Would recommend putting some dried sage in the pierogi\u2019s then adding some fresh sage with the oil when frying. Paprika was a nice touch. Another great recipe!",
				"Took a few hours from start to finish, but it was 100% worth the work! Next time I might just make the filling and eat it straight from the pan ;)",
				"Great recipe, thank you! I cooked them the same way as Japanese gyoza dumplings (directly in the pan) and they come out delicious :)",
				"I was so happy to see someone else who fries up their pierogi with an onion and crumb coating! Our family has always used sauteed onions and bread crumbs to add extra flavor and texture to this meal staple. I have not come across many other people who cook their pierogi this way. The walnut crumb sounds deliciously different and I will try it out next time I make them!!",
				"Hello, I love your blog! Super great discovery in these weird times! I was wondering if you have any experience in using buckwheat flour to replace all purpose flour in a recipe such as this? My husband can't have gluten and I have never tried making dough for these types of recipes with buckwheat and so I wonder if I would have to substitute or add anything? Any ideas would help tremendously as we looooove pierogi!!!! All my best wishes from Madrid, Lua.",
				"I just discovered your blog thanks to thekitchn, and I made these right away. We had everything we needed but the porcini, but we made do with a little extra soy sauce instead. They came out looking so cute and were delicious. It was my first time making pierogi, and it was fun to have a distraction while we quarantine My three year old loved helping assemble them. Thank you for your lovely blog. I can't wait to try more recipes!",
				"I made these on Thursday to use up some mushrooms I had in the fridge - super tasty and easy to make (even with an amended filling due to lack of porcini etc)! Will certainly be making again :)",
				"Made these tonight with my kids.  We love to experiment and try new recipes out together.  They were fantastic and made enough to freeze for a second meal, which was nice as it was a fair amount of work.  Thanks so much for posting!",
				"Hello--can't wait to make these later today!  Question: in the directions to make the filling, you say to add porcini stock, but there's no mention of stock in the ingredients list. How much stock should we use? Thank you!",
				"I can\u2019t wait to make these. Thank you!!",
				"These looks delicious! I haven't had these in years... if I want to freeze half the portion since it's just my husband and I, how would I go about that? Thanks!"

				{
					"GNOCCHI": [
						"1. Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (no fan).",
						"2. Pierce the clean potatoes all over with a skewer or a sharp knife. Place on a baking tray and bake for about 60 minutes (for medium size potatoes), turning to the other side halfway through (be sure to use kitchen gloves or kitchen tongs). They are ready as soon as a sharp knife slides in easily.",
						"3. While the potatoes are baking, prepare your work bench by cleaning it and sprinkling with a generous amount of flour.",
						"4. As soon as the potatoes come out of the oven, cut them in half. Put each half (skin on) into a potato ricer so that the cut side is right against the mesh. Rice the potatoes all over the prepared work bench area, spreading them a little (instead of placing all the flesh in one massive heap) so that more steam can escape as they cool.",
						"5. Once you are done with all the potatoes, you may want to go over the skins with a spoon, scooping the rest of the flesh and ricing it \u2013 I find that there is always a generous layer of potato flesh left.",
						"6. Sprinkle riced potatoes evenly with salt, nutmeg and half of the flour and then using a large knife (a pastry cutter or a bench scraper) cut the flour into the potatoes using a chopping motion.",
						"7. Next use your hands to knead the dough very gently as you do want a uniform dough to form, but you do not want to knead it too much as that will develop gluten in the flour and your gnocchi will be chewy. Keep on adding a little bit of flour at a time until the dough isn\u2019t sticky anymore. The less flour the better (produces lighter gnocchi) but too little flour will make them fall apart in cooking so don\u2019t go crazy. A good guide is about 10-15% flour compared to the weight of uncooked potatoes.",
						"8. Once you have a uniform dough that holds together well yet it is still very pliable, divide it into quarters. Roll each quarter into a long thin snake. Using a knife, cut the snake into same size pieces. Coat them lightly in flour.",
						"9. OPTIONALLY, you may want to ridge your gnocchi using the tines of a fork (or a gnocchi board if you own one), but that part is fairly time consuming, takes a while to get the hang of and it\u2019s not necessary, especially if you intend to serve them simply, in sage and garlic-flavoured olive oil. The idea is that the ridges help the gnocchi to hold more sauce, so if you are serving yours with a rag\u00f9, for example, you may want to spend the extra time. To ridge the gnocchi, roll each piece into a ball and then gently roll it against the back of the fork.",
						"10. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Put a batch (say 20 \u2013 depends on the size of your pot) into the boiling water. Give the water a gentle stir and wait for the gnocchi to resurface (1-2 minutes). As soon as they come to the surface, scoop them up with a slotted spoon. Allow the excess water to drain away over the pot and place on a clean plate. Continue with the rest of your gnocchi.",
						"11. If you like your gnocchi pan-fried, allow them to cool down completely before frying or, even better, store them in the fridge overnight or else they will fall apart and turn into mush. I\u2019ve also tried frying them from raw (i.e. no prior boiling) and it does work but you need to fry them on a low heat and for a longer period of time to make sure the flour inside is fully cooked.",
						"12. To pan-fry your gnocchi, bring a non-stick pan to temperature, cover the bottom of the pan with olive oil, let the oil get hot and then throw cold gnocchi into the oil. Shake the pan to coat the gnocchi in oil and then leave undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms of the gnocchi get caramelised. Toss the pan again and continue in the same manner until the gnocchi is golden on both sides. Serve with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, crushed hazelnuts and fried sage leaves (see below)."

					"SAGE AND GARLIC OLIVE OIL (for boiled gnocchi)": [

						"2. Add chopped garlic to the sage flavoured oil. Gently cook the garlic for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time, but do not allow it to brown as it will taste bitter. If the garlic is sizzling too aggressively, turn the heat off (or take the pan off the heat if not using gas) and allow it to cook in the residual heat.",
						"3. Add nutritional yeast to the garlicky oil, a good pinch of salt and a splash of gnocchi cooking water and whisk until emulsified. If the sauce is too thin, allow the excess water to cook out until it reaches the desired consistency.",
						"4. Toss the drained gnocchi in the sauce well, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with mild chilli (if using).",

				"Best recipe I\u2019ve come across for gnocchi! I\u2019ve made some real duds in the past. I don\u2019t have a ricer so I mashed the living **** out of the potatoes. Used 00 flour. This was delightfully fluffy, melt in your mouth gnocchi.Thanks for the recipe! \ud83d\ude4f",
				"Thanks for taking the time to reply, and so quickly! I\u2019m glad to hear it\u2019s not just me, haha! :) I actually used red-skinned rooster potatoes, not sure why I said russet (I\u2019ve been reading too many American recipes perhaps!) so will try when we next have some Maris Pipers and see if this helps. Thanks again, Danielle x",
				"Hi Ania, thanks for another tasty recipe, although I must confess I wasn\u2019t completely successful with this one! I used russet potatoes and 00 flour, and I guess I didn\u2019t use enough flour/knead enough, because my first batch did fray when boiling, as you mentioned. I kneaded more flour into my remaining dough (hadn\u2019t rolled this out yet) and while these were better, there was still room for improvement.. thankfully they weren\u2019t gummy, but they were almost too soft?! I may have made them slightly too large as well, so that probably didn\u2019t help! I\u2019ll have to try again, possibly with a different potato variety, or being a bit bolder with the flour and kneading... I was probably over-cautious! Nevertheless, after a few hours in the fridge they fried up nicely and were perfectly tasty with a tomato sauce - two of us ate the whole lot in one sitting!",
				"I have been reading about people who grate the cooked potato for a lighter mix - mashing did not work for me",
				"What would you replace the potato ricer with? How can I achieve similar texture without this equipment? Thanks a lot!",

Remember to give the sauce a good stir from time to time to ensure that the middle of the pan does not burn.",

They were just a bit salty (I blame the chocolate) and too crispy. So I wanted to know if you have a tip for them not to be too crispy. In which form you put them on the tray?

I made these for a diary free and an allergic to loads of things audience so used gluten free flour and didn\u2019t add the nuts. I didn\u2019t use the cardamom either but did add some orange rind, which smelt delicious while cooking. They were loved by everyone! This is the second gluten free sweet recipe I\u2019ve tried from this site and they are both marvellous (I\u2018ve also made the gluten free raspberry brownies). What I love is that they are good recipes, producing beautiful sweet goodies in their own right. These aren\u2019t just \u2018good for vegan\u2019 or \u2018good for gluten free\u2019. They\u2019re just good! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe."

I would be with you, meandering and taking my time. Actually, let's be real, I'm such a klutz I'd have fallen off my bike two minutes in and had to go home.Is that a cast iron grill pan you have? Just wondering if you have any seasoning tips? I've had a cast iron grill pan but no matter what I do I can't seem to get it to season properly, it is like it always gets sticky around the grill bits. And most of the tutorials I've looked at are for flat pans."

The other 2.5, and a few carrots, I grated into the risotto.My beetroots were incredibly sweet, and the risotto turned out sweeter than I'd've liked, so I stirred in some tart soy yoghourt before serving, and it cut through the sweetness perfectly.I'll definitely be making this one again and again !",

Out of revulsion and the realization that I could never kill an animal for consumption, and the inability to distance myself from the reality and tragedy of meat, I became a vegetarian 48 years ago at age 12, then a vegan 25 years later. It wasn't easy back then, comparatively you have ir sooo good now, vegan dishes at most restaurants, all kinds of prepared foods available, which brings me to my point-I'm sure your recipe is delicious, but I'm not doing all of that work, I'm going to make do with some 'Tofutti' brand pseudo cream cheese. Good for you though, my loss I'm sure.",

It was not for me and we ate pounds of really good cheese a month; Jarlsberg on counter for snacking , always, and  several cheese and veggies loaded frittatas a week. (I baked a whole one, sans onion, for dog.)  I use soaked cashews for all kinds of cheese replacements. I'm a bit concerned about leaving this out for days. I live in the humid, hot tropics, basically in the jungle (a petri dish for all kinds of microbes in the air) with no very cool place to set the cheese while it is doing it's thing. The day time temps in house are  about 29C =  84F. I will be making the ricotta  cheese soon and will report back."

				"Amazing as always! I used yoghurt instead of tahini sauce and it was also great.",
				"Hello! Just want to let you know that this recipe was amazing! The tahini dressing is to die for and the mince was Soo good",
				"Hi Ania,Pure food heaven - an outstanding dish - restaurant worthy.  I did my eggplant on the bbq direct over the coals - took about 30 minutes ( about 5 minutes or so cut side down and then the rest cut side up). I loved every aspect of the dish - the flavours, the textures and the presentation.  This is going to be on my weekly menu frequently.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.",
				"Thank you so much for your recipes, this one like all your others was wonderful. The only things I did different was I went oilless and grilled the eggplant, onions and tomatoes outside since I live  in southeast Alabama and didn't want to heat up the house too much. Then saut\u00e9ed the garlic chopped up the grilled tomatoes and onion and brought it together with the lentils and spices and topped the eggplants. That touch of tahini and lemony dressing was a great touch and I used the leftoves to dress a nice green side salad. Thanks again for your recipes.",
				"Hi Ania,I have been a long time visiter of your beautiful blog and have commented a few times on some recipes I made and enjoyed. This time I really wanted to let you know that I feel exactly the same way as you do about trying to make friends - you describe the difficulty of making new friends just how it is. Most people of my age (I am a bit older than you are) already have their life made in term of having a husband/life partner, maybe some kids, a nice house, at least one car, a career and a good circle of friends. Many people have a full agenda, no time for anything that is not planned in their busy schedule. And no interest in other people because it is already difficult enough to keep all their existing relationships active. Not having the luck of obtaining all, or at least some of these things, is sometimes difficult; I can't have a conversation about my kids, the new car I bought, the promotion I had or the parties I went to. Well, I know not everybody has that same life as I described it earlier, but sometimes it seems like they do - doesn't it?I just wanted to let you know you are not alone in feeling lonesome at times. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.As always, the recipe looks delicious.Best wishes,Yvonne",
				"Ania, Love your recipes, thank you. A thought regarding establishing new friendships.  Volunteer organizations always need people.  Clubs like Rotary that I also belong to are a fabulous way of meeting new people world wide (they have clubs globally and of course in Athens), and they do many worthwhile projects and community activities.  Good Luck and don't be shy.  Tom",

I don't do the maple syrup but I cut up a date and put it in for some sweetness and occasionally add some raisins too! Adding frozen fruit to my oats when I make them is also something that I do quite often. In the morning I love to top it off with fresh berries and homemade cinnamon almond butter... and don't forget a fresh cup of coffee to go along with them!Thanks for the recipe!",

				"Baked this today and unfortunately it turned out dry and just blah tasting. I did substitute whole wheat flour in so I wonder if that\u2019s what made it so much more dense?",
				"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe! I deeply appreciate how delicate the flavor is. I am a passionate home cook who has just started down the twisting and turning path of baking. I did not have almond flower so I halved the amount and used AP flour. I\u2019m guessing this is why my batter looked more like dough after combining the wet and dry? Thick and sticky with lots of texture. I\u2019d love an answer to that if you could confirm? With my snafu, the cake was more like a bread and had a 45 minute cook time. My fianc\u00e9 and I ate every crumb in 36 hours :)",
				"Hello, this recipe looks amazing! Can I ask whether it\u2019s possible to make in advance and freeze before baking or would this affect the texture of the fruit too much?",

				"Hi, this recipe looks divine! I was wondering if it might be possible to use applesauce in place of the almond butter, or might that change the texture of the cake too much? Thanks!",
				"Dear Cat, I was wondering if you could clarify what you mean by ground almonds.  I'm in California and we have \"almond flour\" which is very fine but no ground almonds, so I'm not sure what the texture is supposed to be like for your cake.  The peaches, nectarines and plums are lusty and fragrant right now - this cake would be perfect to use up the bounty.   Thanks :)",
				"For the \"ground almonds\" - just how finely ground are these? Can one use almond flour? Thank you",
				"I noticed your recipe calls for Koko brand yogurt, peavh and passion fruit flavored. We don't have Koko brand yogurt here, sonim mot sure how thick it is. My usual is Silk plain, which is a little on the thinner side, unflavored and unsweetened. Do you recommend a flavored yogurt that is sweetened?  I sometimes use Silk vanilla which is of course vanilla flavored, and sweetened-but not exactly thick. Also, where do you find ground almonds?Thanks!!P.S. This recipe sounds yummy!!"

				"Every recipe of yours that I have tried has always turned out exceptional.  You are a talented chef.  With this recipe, would it be possible to use flax seed instead of chia seeds?  I am assuming that the seeds provide a binder for the fritters.  Thank you,",
				"Delicious!! Great recipe as all the rest we have made from your blog. (what we had and used  was flax seeds,and regular white flour, but I'm sure chickpea flour will make them even better)",
				"Made these and loved them they were easy  to cook as previously I\u2019ve struggled with fritters being gloopy and messy . Definitely will make again! I\u2019d add a bit of chilli next time to ring the changes",
				"OMG, these are so good! Just made a batch with what I had available and they are a keeper... the capers taste amazing and I added a finely chopped green chilli and a heaped tbsp of parmesan. Yum!",
				"Hi! Are these able to be refrigerated? And if so how long will they last?\ud83d\ude0a",
				"These are DELICIOUS! Thank you for the recipe!I've made a few of your recipes now and with an excess of courgettes from the garden I was thinking of fritters. I did a quick Google search and as soon as I saw the Lazy Cat Kitchen link I knew I was onto a winner. I used plain flour instead of chickpea. They didn't last long enough to take a picture!",
				"These were amazing! My husband, who isn't normally a huge fan of meatless dishes, loved this. Very flavorful and quick to make. I halved the recipe, substituted cilantro for the mint, and had to fry them on medium heat on my stovetop. I served it with a creamy cilantro mint dressing and it was superb.",
				"Loving your blog and instagram! I could never make these right! Do you think I can bake these without adding any oil?",
				"Thanks for this delicious  recipe. Worked out beautifully.",
				"Made these tonight. Very soft and delicate. I served them with a hot chili sauce that I made for a different recipe and it was a little overpowering but still a delicious meal. Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania! Have you tried baking these instead of frying? I guess they won't be so crispy, but just wondering to make them even healthier ;) Thank you!",
				"This looks and tastes really good!",
				"Hi, your dishes are always a big hit in our home. Thank you for sharing all these wonderful Vegan recipes.I made the courgette fritters with flax seed and rice flour and it worked well. I added a bit more rice flour. And, I discovered that there are an older version of this recipe on pinterest - I added brown rice instead of breadcrumbs. We ate it with yogurt and Ajvar. Ajvar was a perfect combo :-) Lovely summer dish. Kind regards from Nina in Norway",
				"Would it work just as well cooking it with the minimum oil or in the oven\u2753I don't like eating frights but the concept sounds really good thanks for the recipe",
				"Oh, I feel you. I have contracted tendons in my legs and no matter what they will not be straight and I cannot do fancy poses where they need to be, even with the hot sweaty bikram yoga that I do. Thankfully at my yoga studio, there is no pressure to get to the full extension of the posture, even just doing the set up and as much as you can is fine. I hope you find a good studio and instructors who will respect your body and its limits!I also just found out about Serial earlier this year, thanks to my brother, and listened to the whole thing so fast. It is such a great podcast!Lovely looking recipe as well, I love fritters!",
				"I am growing courgettes in my garden this year so this recipe is perfect for me. I'll let you know how it goes! Thank you for the tip about the Serial  podcast, I'm hooked now! Do you have a patreon account it another way to support your work?",
				"Dear Ania Thank you  for your advice. I will try to get chia seeds;)",
				"Hey, I don\u2019t really write comments usually but I really enjoy your recipes and how you\u2019re always letting us have a little view into your life. I just wanted to pop by to recommend you fightmasteryoga on YouTube. I\u2019ve been practicing with her for years and I think she\u2019s really a great person. She\u2019s been promoting herself and her programs a bit more in her videos recently, so just don\u2019t let yourself be put off by that. Especially the 30 Day Hatha yoga challenge I would recommend. Wish you good luck and a lot of fun on your yoga journey and hope you\u2019ll find a good in person teacher soon. Have a great day!",
				"And what can i use instead of chickpea flour? I don\u2019t have access to this \ud83d\ude48 Thank you for a recipe!",
				"Hi Ania, thanks for the recipe. Could you please advise on kcal per 1 fritter..? Thanks very much.",
				"These look great, can\u2019t wait to make them! I love the videos on YouTube for Yoga with Adriene. She has a way of encouraging you to be right where you are and push a bit further if you think you want to. I\u2019ve been following her for years and have become more flexible over time, without any of the pressure or guilt.",
				"Hi AniaCan I use flax seeds instead of chia?",
				"Thanks for the recipe, Anya,I will try it shortly. I like the idea of chia seeds!As for your yoga class, the instructor seems to have more of a ballet mindset than the mindset of an authentic yoga instructor. Maybe you need to find another class where the instructor creates a peaceful atmosphere and helps all people, wherever they are at.Thank you for this fantastic blog!",
				"Oh my, these look so yummy and of course super healthy!!!!"

I work with the NHS as an interpreter and see the strain they are under but also how amazingly professional and as you mention, kind and empathetic they always are. Real life superheroes. Wishing Duncan a very speedy recovery. And thanks for all the wonderful recipes. I used to love Eton Mess before going vegan so I must try this.  It's the perfect light summer dessert. I have had one attempt at making vegan meringues and it wasn't great but you have inspired me to try again. The recipe I used before didn't have any lemon juice so maybe that was the problem. Do you think lemon juice is better than cream of tartar which I see in a lot of aquafaba meringue recipes?  Anyway,I will go and experiment!"

I get a local organic veg box and for the last five weeks I've been receiving a kilo of broad beans in it with more to come this week (and probably the next few as well). Yesterday I shelled all the ones I hadn't yet used as a side to make space in my fridge and was searching my recipe books for what to do with them en masse. Then this arrived. I've just made it and love it! Thank you :-) By the way it's the first time I've commented but you're one of my favourite vegan bloggers."

Yes, I know, it does take some time!\nFinally add in about 75 ml / 5 tbsp of ice cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife.\nYou may need a bit more water, but add it very gradually (teaspoon by teaspoon) as too much will make the pastry tough. To check if more water is needed, grab a handful of mixed dough with your hands, if it is very dry, add a little more water, mix it in and check again.\nOnce the dough is the right consistency, form it into a flattened ball quickly \u2013 handle the dough as little as possible, wrap it in cling film and chill for 30-60 minutes.\nRemove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness.

Alternatively, you could do what I did, which is I charred the asparagus on a hot griddle pan separately and decorated the tart with charred asparagus AFTER baking.",

Also had a bunch of zucchini. Just randomly came across this and no second thoughts!After I cooked the zucchini, it was so good, I ate half while cooking the asparagus. So I had to cook more. Lol.

Mine were 9 g / 0.3 oz each, I used scales to ensure they are all the same size. Roll each piece into a long, thin snake. Fold the right end over the left to form a loop. Continue until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough.",
				"6. Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle boil and prepare a baking tray with a metal rack on top or a regular tray lined with a clean kitchen towel.",
				"7. Give the water a gentle stir and place 10 taralli in the simmering water at one time. As soon as each tarallo comes up to the surface, fish it out with a slotted spoon and place on the prepared tray, prettier side up. Allow all of the taralli to drain and dry out completely before baking.",
				"8. Set the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F and bake cool taralli in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes \u2013 until golden brown. You may want to brush the taralli with some extra olive oil before baking for a nicer finish, but that\u2019s totally optional. Allow the taralli to cool off completely before getting stuck in \u2013 they get crispier as they cool."

If the water has evaporated and the tomatoes are still chunky, feel free to add another splash of water and make sure the pan is on a low heat. Traditionally, this sauce is meant to be fairly loose, but I like it a little bit thicker \u2013 adjust the consistency to your own taste.",

				"First things first, this was delicious. The lemongrass flavour was lovely (although I did try to use fresh but it was a bit tough so used some lemongrass paste which I had in the fridge and used the fresh for flavour when simmering). I baked the tofu and that was perfect for us. Adding mint is such a great idea too it really compliments the dish. Will definitely make this again. Thanks",
				"I made this tonight and it was very flavorful. I love lemongrass, but I had never cooked with it until now.I actually used soy curls instead of tofu just because I was making a cabbage and carrot slaw along with this that had tofu as well. The soy curls were good--but as you noted, any crispiness from pan-frying gets lost when it goes in the sauce. I'll try baking next time for a healthier preparation. Fresh tomatoes worked really well too. I look forward to checking out more of your recipes.",
				"I totally love tofu :-) Can you also recommend a wine which is suitable with this dish? Thanks, Makita",
				"Hi Ania, that's a lovely recipe. I was determined to try it as we have a very good Vietnamese restaurant nearby, whose tofu is the best in the known universe. By coincidence, a friend called round tonight so I had a willing victim to try out the recipe, and got full marks from them, so thank you! I didn't manage to find any coriander today, but it was just fine without it (I also used pre-marinated tofu to save hassle).  But a big 'thumbs up' all round. Will definitely try this one again!Hope your shingles improve soonest.",
				"Don't want to be intrusive, could be a sign of kidney issues,head to a seasoned acupuncturist whilst waiting for your *doctor*-good luck C",

				"I was going to mention shingles also. AND I understand you can have shingles pain etc without an outward physical sign. It can affect the nerves without seeing it on the skin. Unusual but it can happen!  So don't let them make you think you are a hypochondriac and stay on it. There are antiviral meds that can really help the pain and symptoms!  (Not a Doc! but have had several bouts starting in my 40's so I feel your pain!) Hope you get some relief soon!",

Caramel will thicken as it cools, if it\u2019s too loose, bring it back to a gentle simmer again and simmer for a few minutes to thicken. If it\u2019s too runny, add a splash more almond milk.",

				"5. Place the chocolate and 1 tsbp of almond milk in a glass or metal bowl over a pot of gently simmering water. Simmer on low heat until the chocolate is almost melted \u2013 err on the side of caution as it is important for the chocolate not to overheat. Take the bowl off the pot with hot water and let it sit there.",
				"6. Gently and slowly whisk chocolate until smooth. You may want to add a bit of maple syrup to the mixture at this point. I did not as I feel that caramel provides enough sweetness to this dessert, but it\u2019s down to personal preference. If your chocolate seizes, which happens sometimes, bring it back by whisking in another 1-2 tablespoons of room temperature almond milk. Allow this mixture to cool down a little.",
				"7. While the chocolate is cooling, whisk aquafaba and a few drops of acid (it helps it stiffen) with an electric whisk until you achieve stiff peaks. Aquafaba needs to be so stiff that you should be able to invert the bowl over your head.",
				"8. Gradually (start off with 1/3 of whipped aqauafaba) and gently fold whipped aquafaba into the chocolate mixture until the two are well incorporated. The mixture will deflate a little, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal, but you don\u2019t want it to deflate too much by knocking too much air out of the mixture, which is why a gentle and slow folding motion is key here.",
				"9. Spoon the mousse on top of the cold caramel and chill the dessert in the fridge until the mousse is fully set (I recommend for 8 hours / overnight). Decorate if you wish and serve."

				"Hi Ania, Your website did not notify me that you have replied to my comment, so only now I read your comment :) The chocolate seized up... Adding almond milk did not help. I guess that mixing liquid with chocolate isn't the best idea?As for the aquafaba - I knew it's ready because I could turn the bowl upside down and it stayed in place. After I mixed the chocolate, the \"magic\" of the aquafaba was lost, and even after I left it in the fridge, it turned into a drink... I have tried to use aquafaba several times to make mousse but it always turned the same, unlike this recipe: https://www.feastingonfruit.com/3-ingredient-vegan-chocolate-pots/ Thank you <3",
				"I am really dissapointed....The 1tsp of soy milk and a bit of maple syrup distoryed 150gram of 85% high quality chocolate.I tried again and spent another 150gram together with about 1/2 tsp refiend coconut oilAfter I whipped the aquafaba  (i could turn it upside down) I folded some of the chocolate and then I said goodbye to my aquafaba. It turned into a drink instead of a mousse! Even though it will never be a mousse, I tried to split the amount of chocolate into the cups. You have said that it should fit 4 cups. It's not enough even for one glass...  the fouth cup from the left has no chocolate at all. https://i.ibb.co/Qrj3wdC/IMAG0306.jpg",

				"SO DELICIOUS! I never bother to write reviews. This was one of my favorite recipes I\u2019ve ever cooked. I breaded the tempeh first by dipping the pieces in a flax egg, then in a mix of rice flour and corn starch (best mix for crispness). I fried it in cast iron skillet, which also makes a huge flavor and crispness. Due to lack of ingredients at home, subbed in lemon juice for The lime juice, and some finely grated lemon zest and extra ginger instead of lemongrass. And regular onion for shallots. And Frank\u2019s buffalo sauce instead of sracha/other hot sauce, haha. Anyway, thanks again for the great recipe! :)",

				"Thanks!!",

A really tasty  sauce and the texture of the aubergines from frying and then cooking them in the sauce was lovely. I enjoyed this with some (vegan) hot mango chutney as I am a bit of a fiend. Will  definitely be trying your other recipes!  What a great site",

			"recipe": [
				"1. If using aubergines rather than a ready smoked pulp (see below), pierce the aubergines with a knife so that the steam can escape whilst they are cooking. If you have a gas hob, switch the burner on and place an aubergine (one at a time) directly on the burner. Using metal tongs or a fork, turn the aubergine every 2-3 minutes so that a new area of skin is exposed to a naked flame with each turn. Allow them to sit on the burner for as long as it takes the skin to blacken, blister and the inside to collapse significantly.",
				"2. As soon as each aubergine is done, place it in a large bowl and cover it with a tight fitting lid or a piece of cling film so that the skin is easier to take off.",
				"3. While the aubergines are resting, chop the garlic roughly and then smash it with a pinch of salt and the blade of a knife until you get a fine paste. Place it in a small bowl and cover with 2 tsp of lemon juice and set aside \u2013 this will mellow out the garlic\u2019s flavour.",
				"4. Once the aubergines are cool enough to handle, cut them in half and scoop out all the flesh using a spoon. Place the flesh on a sieve and leave for a bit (the longer the better) to allow all the excess liquid to drain away.",
				"5. Using a fork, mash the aubergine flesh and mix in salt, tahini, pomegranate molasses, cumin (if using) and mellowed out garlic.",
				"6. To serve, transfer the dip in a bowl, garnish it with pomegranate seeds, chopped parsley and extra virgin olive oil, if using. It tastes best the day after it has been made."

I love the new harbour walk - I used to run there and it was much harder navigating the old industrial states around - still worth it to see the suspension bridge. And so much vegan food! Anyways about the recipe, I really like the idea of using lemon juice to tame the garlic. Never felt confident enough to use the hob to roast anything, but I will give it a try.

				{
					"BASIC CHALLAH RECIPE": [
						"250 g / 2 cups bread flour",
						"250 g / 2 cups all purpose flour",
						"4 tsp instant dried yeast (prior activation is necessary with non-instant dried yeast)",
						"4 tbsp sugar (you can use maple syrup, but use less orange juice to compensate)",
						"1 tsp salt",
						"180 ml / \u00be cup orange juice or almond milk, lukewarm",
						"180 ml / \u00be cup thick vegan yogurt (I used The Coconut Collective), at room temperature",
						"2 tbsp olive oil (or any other vegetable oil) + a little extra for pan glazing",
						"2 tbsp apricot jam, pressed through a sieve"
					]
				},
				{
					"EASTER ADD-ONS": [
						"75 g / 10 dried apricots",
						"70 g / 1/3 cup sultanas",
						"100 g / \u00bd cup almonds, chopped"
					]
				}
			],
			"time": "35 min",
			"serving": "makes 1 loaf",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Sift the flours into a large mixing bowl and mix in yeast, sugar and salt. If your yeast requires activation, add the activated yeast in the next step.",
				"2. Pour in the lukewarm orange juice, vegan yogurt, olive oil and stir everything together with a large wooden spoon until roughly combined.",
				"3. Knead it lightly for about 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface \u2013 don\u2019t knead too much to keep the bread delicate! The dough will be on the wet side, if it\u2019s too hard to handle, dust with a bit more flour, but don\u2019t go nuts \ud83d\ude09 .",
				"4. Form a dough ball and place it in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel. Place the bowl in a warm (but not too warm \u2013 avoid going too close to an open fire or a hot radiator) place until the dough has doubled in size (approx. 1-2 hrs)**.",
				"5. Meanwhile, immerse sultanas and apricots in a little hot water for 5 minutes to rehydrate them. Drain and squeeze the excess moisture out of them using a sieve or a muslin cloth. Chop the apricots into fine dice.",
				"6. Mix apricots, sultanas and almonds together.",
				"7. Split the dough into three, four, five or six equal parts \u2013 it\u2019s best to use kitchen scales here. The type of braid you make is up to you \u2013 I found this video really helpful. I went with a five braid loaf, but the instructions below are how to make the simplest of them all \u2013 a three strand braid.",
				"8. Roll each part into a long rectangle using a rolling pin. Sprinkle the rectangle with a portion of fruit and nuts and then roll up into a tight strand with both hands, applying even pressure. Once all your stands are ready ensure they are all similar width and length.",
				"9. Place all three strands on a lightly oiled baking tray alongside each other, leaving a bit of space around each strand.",
				"10. First pinch the ends of the three strands together at one end, then start braiding by folding the right strand over the centre strand and then the left one over the centre strand. Repeat until you get to the other end. Pinch the ends together again. Fold both pinched ends underneath the bread gently.",
				"11. Cover the bread and rest for another 60 minutes, until fully proofed \u2013 if you poke it with your fingertip, it should not spring back fully, but retain a little indent.",
				"12. Pre-heat the oven to 190\u00b0 C / 375\u00b0 F while the bread is resting. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until nicely brown on top.",
				"13. Glaze while hot, with apricot jam mixed in with 2 tbsp water."

				"Hi Ania, I\u2019ve been making this Challah every Friday for about a month now- we love it!!! I haven't had challah in over 11 years  ( since I went vegan) and didn\u2019t think I would ever taste it again.  Thank you so much for this excellent and easy  recipe!!! Forever grateful!!",
				"Hi Ania, I made this challah for a vegan get together with friends and everyone loved it. Thanks for the great recipe! :)",

				"This looks amazing!!! I haven\u2019t made challah in 9 years (since becoming vegan), and I\u2019ve missed it every Friday evening. Will definitely try this next week when Passover concludes. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.",
				"\ud83d\ude43hi there. Some rime ago you mentioned you'd be plastering a lot. Probably too late (the rate at which you accomplish things) but  my husband's top tips, gathered from a lifetime of renovating our various homes) are: use Bondcre 1:4 with water prior to plastering. It's sticky and is good for helping marry the plaster to the old surface. Otherwise the old surface can suck the water out of the plaster mix.Use plasterer 's sand, not  brickies if mixing your own.Work quickly when applying.Rough textured surface, even slightly so, far easier than going for super smooth. What did the Victorians do, hopefully rough \u263a\ufe0fThere used to be a paint that had a rough surface and great colours but hell to get off if repainting.The consistency of the plaster should be like toothpaste.Apparently all this will mean nothing if you are using a plasterer ready mix bag. He says he was rendering not plastering as such though he did do it inside.Ps i did my fair share and have the hands to prove it \ud83d\ude0fI'm excited for you both, we always enjoyed transforming \ud83d\ude09",
				"Oh!  I am so happy you shared this recipe.  I've been wanting to make challah for a long time, but never saw a vegan version before yours!  Thank you, it looks delicious and beautiful.",

				"Excellent! Since we aren't vegan, I used cooked chicken instead of a second can of beans. I also didn't add the second can of water since I was running out of time.  A 9 x 9 pan was used as I didn't have the specified size.",
				"I love the look of this recipe, thank you so much it looks fabulous! I was just wondering if it is freezable? Many thanks :)",
				"Thank you for your lovely website and recipes! This is the best ever recipe! Sooo tasty. I  am about 85%  Vegan  and this is my favourite recipe so far and I have made it several times.  Today I am using a jalape\u00f1o \u2018cheese \u2019  Sauce. I haven\u2019t tried the cauliflower b\u00e9chamel yet, that is next on the list to make!",
				"The beat thing ever! Sooo tasty. Love it, thank you!",
				"Ah alright! That makes sense, thanks Ania- I'll let you know how it goes x",
				"HI!I was looking forward to making this recipe- but due to the current climate, store shelves are pretty empty. I couldn't get enough sauce ingredients so I'm going to have to sub them for premade sauce and add my own spices. Do you think it'll be alright?As well as this, I only have 1 can of black beans! Could I use 1 can of black beans & 1 can of kidney beans or do you think it'll taste too funky?  If so, do you recommend any other type of bean to sub the missing black beans for?Thanks in advance! I hope you are well :)",
				"Can I pre-cook the potato slices slightly in the microwave so it takes less time in the oven? Will this work or is it a bad idea? I was thinking of cooking them in the microwave whilst making the sauce, maybe until they're slightly soft. It would be great to cut down on the time taken to make it as much as possible! Love your website by the way- I'm so glad I found it as I'm trying to cook more plant-based recipes for my non-vegan family. Thanks for all the food inspo as well- Can't wait to try this recipe, hopefully, I'll be able to make it taste as good as it looks! :) xx",
				"Hi Ania, I can't wait to try this recipe. I just have one question.You mention: \"200 g / 7 oz melty vegan cheese, shredded or homemade cashew bechamel**\"If I choose to make the homemade b\u00e9chamel you mention in the other recipe, the ingredients of that recipe will give me the exact amount of sauce that I need for this recipe?Thanks. Tamas",
				"It is delicious! Thank you for this great recipe, I will cook it many times in the future :)",
				"Made this today and it won't be the last time!It's totally delicious. Gave some to my non vegan parents who also dislike sweet potato and they raved about it so had a full portion for their dinner!Served it with coconut collaboration yoghurt and avocado, amazing combo, would never have thought it would work but it does .Coconut collaborative yoghurt is a yummy new find thanks to you.I don't have a mandolin, cut the sweet  potatoes by hand and they were cooked perfectly, more to do with my very sharp knife than my cutting skills I think!!!This is the first of your recipes I've cooked , most definitely won't be the last.Thank you so much \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude38",
				"This is delicious. I'm not vegan, I'm vegetarian, so I used real cheese and sour cream and it was fantastic. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. I love your recipes.",
				"Great recipe! I loved it  <3",
				"Hi Ania, what if I wanted to use fresh tomatoes to make the sauce,how much would I need? And would I also use the same quantitty of water as in the recipe? Thanks!",
				"I'm so glad to hear you're liking your new house! My fianc\u00e9 and I just moved a few months ago ourselves, and it's been really nice setting down our roots :)",
				"Can't wait to try!  Sweet potato slice  thickness?  1/4 inch?  No settings on my mandoline. Good luck with the remodeling!"

				"Thank you for your help! :-) I'll be more careful with the amount of milk this time and I will let you know how  the second attempt went :-) Have a nice weekend!",
				"Hi Ania, the scones look delicious!  I tried to make them, but the dough was too gooey  and sticky  and l had to throw it out. I used  320 ml of almond milk as in the recipe, but after resting in the fridge for 20 minutes the dough was still too wet. I'm a beginner at baking and l would like to ask you a few questions. Is m\u0105ka tortowa, typ 450, ok for this recipe? And should the coconut oil be chilled  before adding it to the dough?  And the last one, what consistency am l looking for? I'll try to make the scones tomorrow  again, wish me luck! :-)",
				"Excellent recipe!",
				"Hello Ania!Thank you for this recipe. The scones are fantadtic. My British friend said they reminded him of his childhood and that must mean something, right?  :) I didn't have a round cookie cutter, so I just sliced them with a knife. All my friends approved of the result! All the best, Paulina",
				"Excellent recipe for Scones !  Have made several times. Whether the cream goes first or the jam  I will not complain \ud83d\ude02  Merci beaucoup Ania \ud83d\udc93",
				"Wow! These were so much better than my regular scones! So much fluffier. Great recipe. Made chia seed  raspberry jam  to go with them.",
				"Dear Ania,What a great recipe! Thank you!I\u2019m making my daughter\u2019s birthday tea party (first time ever baking scones) and tried out 5 different recipes until only with yours, the scones came out the way they look in pictures and oh how delicious!. Fantastic! Thank you so much!Best,Natasha",
				"I've never felt the need to comment on a recipe before but I just made these and they were so good I just had to comment and say how good this recipe is! Vegans and non-vegans loved them! I will definitely be making them many times again, they're just the perfect treat or snack and go amazing with a cup of tea.I personally topped mine with jam and some vegan butter- absolutely delicious.Thank you for your wonderful recipe :)",
				"Hi, Ana, I live in the U..S. (Washington, DC area) and don\u2019t have superfine sugar. Can I use just regular sugar for these scones? Thank you.",
				"Hi, Ania.  I want to make 9 scones not 18. Can I use half ingredients in your recipe? And when I make 9 scones, Is it different bake time, temperature, and so on?And can I use almond flour or oat flour instead of all-purpose flour?And when I use almond flour and oat flour, is it different bake time, temperature and so on..?",

				"Hi Ania. I used to love the way the Brits welcomed all sorts of diversity and I thought of that as one of our best national traits. I feel  ashamed of my own people now, especially as I am a foreigner where I live but the treatment I\u2019ve had from the French has been so much more positive, which really highlights my own country\u2019s bad behaviour. Much as I sympathize with you, however, I must tell you I am firmly on the side of Cornwall as far as scones go!",
				"hey, i was wondering if i can also just cut circles with a knife as i don't have  a cookie cutter?",
				"Hi Ania, thank you for the recipe (this one and all the others). My scones are in the oven now . I had a hard time getting the dough to hold together (keeping in mind to not over work it) . Fingers crossed. Happy Easter !",
				"These look delicious! How long would these last or are they best eaten on the same day?",
				"I am going to try these for my Dad\u2019s tea party tomorrow- they look great. I made your biscotti  as Christmas presents this year and they were perfect. Thank you",
				"Hi AniaI have just made your scones and they are amazing! I have made literally hundreds of regular scones due to my catering career and was interested to see how your vegan recipe would work as a comparison. My boyfriend is vegan and I have also chosen to live a vegan life but  Often found vegan cakes, biscuits and scones disappointing. However, your recipe works so well you wouldn\u2019t know the difference. Thank you so much for making this recipe available so we can all enjoy delicious scones any time",
				"Fluffy dough, soft centre and perfect top crisp!I knew this recipe was brilliant as soon as I began using the cookie cutter. The dough was so fluffy, upon pressing the cutter down, you hear a sudden 'woooof' of air.I substituted:Dough - Coconut oil for Connect Foods, Buttery Spread with probiotics Glaze - Light Olive OilI live in Australia NSW, the butter was bought from Woolworths supermarket.Thank you for sharing (with the world) the best scone recipe.",
				"Hello Ania,I\u2019m definitely going to have a go at making these this afternoon. I can\u2019t wait for the smell to fill the house!I moved from Cornwall to Australia nearly 40 years ago where I have mostly fitted in and been accepted as an \u2018Aussie\u2019. What I find remarkable is that the racism in this country is often directed at our indigenous people, the original inhabitants of this country!! Racism is up there with hatred, jealously, greed, etc, and it\u2019s caused by fear. Where I\u2019m going with this is- don\u2019t let anyone offload their fear on to you. It\u2019s theirs to deal with. Rise above it, and send them healing, loving thoughts. And I will send you healing, loving thoughts! xxx",
				"Made these today and they are delicious.  Just one thing - it's definitely jam first!",
				"HI, Thanks for the recipe!I \u2018ve used sunflower oil instead and used milk. I will let you know how they turned out. Thanks  for the inspiring ideas!",
				"I made the scones today, replacing coconut oil with vegan spread (Naturli) and they turned out great! It's actually the first time ever I made scones so I'm reeeeally excited about the result. Thanks for your great recipes and inspiration, Ania!",
				"Przypadkiem trafi\u0142am na wersje angielsk\u0105 bloga  i tak bardzo si\u0119 ucieszy\u0142am, \u017ce nadal dodajesz nowe przepisy, \u017ce musze zostawi\u0107 komentarz. \u015awietna robota!",
				"Definitely cream first! As a commenter previously mentioned, it's way too hard to spread the cream on top of the jam :p  this whole argument is like when people debate whether the milk or the cereal goes into the bowl first.",
				"These look delicious! Scones are my Mum's go to for if she's got to take something to an event, they're always a crowd pleaser. I'm from Hampshire but in my house it's always jam on first, just because we've found you can get more topping that way ;) There's also the debate of pronunciation, we've always pronounces it like \"stone\" but my brother's gone to uni in Oxford and has come home saying scone like \"gone\" like an alien! Funny how culture can differ even in one country. I'm so sorry for your awful experience. I'm furious with Brexit and, quite frankly, the whole world. We all live on one planet for crying out loud so why can't we just all show a little compassion and consideration towards others.",
				"Just want to say how much I love your recipes! I\u2019ve been vegan for about a year now and they are my absolute \u2018go to\u2019 when I\u2019m trying to decide what to cook. They always work, not all vegan ( or non vegan for that matter) can be relied upon, yours however never fail! Thank you!Also I\u2019m so sorry for your experience with the racist plasterer, I hate this brexit Britain attitude that seems to be becoming exceptable . I am British but have never been so ashamed to admit it. Hang in there !Hope the house goes well.Definitely cream on the bottom!Tanya xxx",
				"Can I use vegan butter instead of the coconut oil?",
				"Just to say I haven\u2019t tried the scones recipe yet but I am very sorry that you had such a bad experience with the ignorant  plasterer. Makes me ashamed of what\u2019s happening to us all.",
				"Can't wait to try this! And it's jam first too :)",
				"Hi  I have just read your  post on scones. I just wanted to say that I am English from Devon.   I love the   diversity we have in this country  and I am appalled by what is going on in this country due to brexit. I hope you don't let the small minority in this country  get to you.  We are an island nation and we should welcome one and all regardless of creed or  race.  Anyway  back to the scones I will have a go at them with some gluten free flour.  Anyway good luck with the plastering and keep up the good work.",
				"I'm with you Ania on this one. Definitely easier if you put the cream on first as you can spread it. Once you've put the jam on, it's very hard to spread the cream around without the jam moving as well.",
				"No... definitely jam first!"

				"There are few things better than this recipe. At this point I have made it more times than I can remember. Have fun with it! You cannot go wrong! We changed up the nut butters ( peanut butter does not disappoint)  Changing/ mixing types of flour to change the consistency, little bit of whiskey in the frosting etc.  Regardless this is , simply, the best.",
				"Can I substitute nut butter for regular butter? And is the texture dry enough so it can be cut in half? I would like to make a sacher torte out of this. Do you think it would work? Thank you.",
				"I  made this with the sweet potatoes and it was amazingly tender and delicious. Wonder if mashed bananas can be substituted for sweet potatoes?  Thanks!",
				"Hi I was going to make this recipe but I\u2019m so confused by the measurements for the sweet potato?? Why does it say 200g of uncooked sweet potato but then switch to cups for the cooked and mashed measurement? How much sweet potato should I use?",
				"Such a delicious cake, the sweet potato gives it a really delicate texture. Thank you!",

				"I\u2019ve just cooked mine! Can\u2019t wait to try it tomorrow! Is this healthier than a normal chocolate cake? Less calories?",
				"Hi Ania, I just tried to make the cake. It's cooling down right at this moment haha. However, I hesitated a lot with the quantity of the sweet potato. In total, is it one sweet potato of 200 g? You say to add 1/2 cup of S. potato (which is 64 g I guess) And I didn't know what to do with the rest. Could you explain me a little bit? Cheers",
				"Hi, will i be able to replace the almond butter with peanut butter or will that ruin the taste? I seem to only be able to find peanut butter at the stores...thanks :)",
				"This cake is divine! I've just made it (without frosting) and I can't stop eating it ;)",
				"Hi  could I use steamed potato instead of baked?",
				"I made this recipe twice by now and every time it come out just perfect. I am making into muffins though.This time I added some chopped up apples and it was even moister. It always is a hit. I love your recipes and have tried quite a lot already. I also love that beet root hummus. It is out of this world. Thank you for the effort you put into this so we can have delicious food.Blessings",
				"I'm usually sceptical when people say that no one realised it was a 'healthy' recipe but in this case it's actually true! I made it in a larger pan so it came out flatter & so moist that I just called them brownies & they're one of my favourite ever brownies that I've made! I agree with several comments that the bake time might need to be a bit longer, but then as I used a different size tin I was expecting to adjust the bake time anyway!",
				"Thanks for sharing this recipe!. I made them into cupcakes, I used tahini instead of nut butter because my kids have nut allergy. I did add 1tbsp of apple cider vinegar just to be sure it could rise. The result was amazing, so moist and fluffy, absolutely will be part of my favourite vegan cakes. Also the frosting is delicious!",

				"Do you take the skin off of the sweet potato?",
				"Sounds yummy!!  Wondering... if I substituted honey or pure maple syrup for 1/2 the coconut sugar, what adjustment might I need to make in order for the cake to not be too wet inside?",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for your response! I used caster sugar for this recipe so I'm guessing it's my oven - I've noticed it doesn't bake very evenly and just isn't very reliable in general so probably nothing to do with your recipe. I was still very happy with the result and will try again :)",
				"A lovely recipe, definitely my favourite vegan chocolate cake as others taste of soda too much. The texture of this is lovely too. I have to admit though, I didn't read the recipe properly and I boiled my potato instead of roasting it so I don't know if it would be even better when roasted. Thankyou for sharing x",
				"OMG I made these into cupcakes. These are delicious, especially if you heat them up a little in the microwave. YUM!!!",
				"Hi Ania,This looks amazing and I want to give this a try ASAP . Is there  ang alternatives to the almond or hazelnut butter as I have a slight nut allergy ?Thank  you!",
				"Hi Ania! I made this cake today and think the sweet potato is a beautiful idea and works perfectly for the texture of the cake as well as for the icing. I stuck to the original recipe but had to bake it quite a bit longer (90 minutes) until it was baked through. The crumb is really nice and moist but the cake has somewhat of a tough, chewy crust. I noticed that many vegan cakes  I've made recently turned out this way and I'm wondering if this has to do with my oven or if that's just a characteristic of a vegan cake...? I'd appreciate your advice / opinion! Otherwise, great flavour and texture - I will make it again!",
				"Thanks Ania! I left out the nut butter completely and used maple syrup instead of sugar. So I definitely made it too wet then - whoops! Great to know about the cacao and baking soda! The flavour of the cake is gorgeous.",
				"Hi Anya - I absolutely love your recipes !!! Is lemon or apple cider vinegar needed to activate the baking soda? I made this cake last night and the mixture was thick and was baking over an hour and still not cooked through. I didn\u2019t use nut butter and maple syrup instead so maybe that\u2019s why..",
				"I baked this yesterday and its amazing, the crumb of the cake is just so moist, I was a bit hesitant about the fristing with the sweet potatoe but it works. The changes I made was I added three quarters of a cup of raw sugar, and added my little secret (to ensure a nice moist cake) a teaspoon of vegetable glycerine, a French pastrychef gave this tip to my Mum years aga and it works a treat. If appears that Claudia's over maybe not working properly, I baked mine at 165 degrees celsius and it took just over an hour",
				"My bread is raw from the center and has been in the oven for more than an hour. :(",
				"This looks incredible, I'm defs making this ASAP. I don't usually like sweet potatoes, bit I got them just for this recipe!"

				"1. Heat up the oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan or pot. Once hot, add mustard seeds, and curry leaves. Fry for a few minutes until the mustard seeds make a popping sound.",
				"2. Add chopped onion and chillies. Fry (stirring now and then) for a few minutes, until softened and lightly caramelised. Add in garlic and ginger and fry off gently until they both become fragrant and the garlic softens.",
				"3. Stir in garam masala and fry off for 1 minute stirring the whole time.",
				"4. Add cubed sweet potatoes and about 1 cup of water. Cover with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes \u2013 until the potatoes are cooked through.",
				"5. Turn off the heat but do not take the lid off just yet \u2013 allow potatoes to finish cooking in their own steam for an extra 5 minutes.",
				"6. Squash the potatoes with a fork / wooden spoon. Sprinkle with lime juice to taste and adjust the amount of salt to taste.",
				"7. Place rice flour, cornflour / cornstarch, salt and turmeric (if using) in a medium mixing bowl.",
				"8. Mix in approximately 2 cups of water to begin with and oil. Set aside for 10 minutes.",
				"9. Give the batter a good mix and check for consistency. It should be runny so you may need to add an extra splash of water to it to achieve this.",
				"10. Heat up a small non-stick pan (mine was 20 cm / 8\u2033 in diameter) on a medium heat. Allow it to get hot before brushing its surface with \u00bd tsp of oil. Allow the oil to heat up. Mix the batter really well before pouring each crepe as rice flour tends to sink to the bottom really quickly.",
				"11. Ladle (do not pour and swivel like you would with regular crepes!) approximately 60 ml / \u00bc cup (if using a 20 cm / 8\u2033 size pan) of batter onto the pan in a circular motion, going from the outside of the pan to the middle. If any gaps form, quickly fill them with a little more batter, but be careful not to make the pancakes too thick by ladling too much extra batter on top of the set batter. There should be lots of little holes forming on the surface as soon as the batter hits the hot pan. If they don\u2019t form it means that your pan / oil isn\u2019t hot enough!",
				"12. Allow the pancake to cook on one side without touching it until the edges become golden and start lifting up gently (approx. 2-3 minutes). Turn the pancake gently using a large spatula and cook on the other side for 1-2 more minutes. The longer you cook them the crispier they\u2019ll become, but they will lose their flexibility. I don\u2019t mind that, but please adjust the cooking time to YOUR preference. Also be aware of your pan\u2019s hot spots \u2013 once you flip your pancake, make sure you adjust its position on the other side to ensure that there are no raw batter areas.",
				"13. Fill each crepe with sweet potato filling and sprinkle with a generous amount of coriander. Serve with coconut yoghurt and a dollop of sour chutney on the side."

				"4. Stir in coconut milk (you can use low-fat coconut milk if you want the curry to be skinnier).",
				"5. Finally add in the lime leaves and stock (or water). Start off with 360 ml / 1\u00bd cups of stock and add more to achieve the desired consistency. Traditionally this curry sauce is fairly thin and soupy in consistency.",
				"6. Allow the sauce to come to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10-15 minutes on a low heat.",
				"7. Season with tamari (soy sauce or vegan fish sauce), lime juice and a touch of sugar (if needed). If you can, allow the curry flavours to develop overnight as it always tastes better the day after it has been made. If you are making this dish a day in advance, I recommend not cooking the vegetables until just before serving.",
				"8. In terms of the veggies, you could simply cook them in the simmering curry, but that gives you less control over the \u2018doneness\u2019 of the individual elements and it affects the colour of the green veggies. I personally prefer to bake the butternut squash and aubergine in the oven and to steam the sugar snap peas and broccoli. I baked the butternut squash and aubergine in a 210\u00b0 C / 410\u00b0 F (190\u00b0 C / 375\u00b0 F with fan) oven for about 20 minutes (turning them once, after 10 minutes) after coating them in a bit of olive oil. I steamed my sugar snap peas for 2 minutes and tenderstem broccoli for 5 minutes.",

				"BEST HOMEMADE GREEN CURRY!! I have made so many, and they all have fallen short of tastiness! This GREEN CURRY is AMAZING! I just cannot believe this has been missing from my life. Thank you so much for this recipe. It is a keeper. I can now stop going to the not so great Thai restaurant in my town for basic green curry.THANK YOU!",

Question though, any chance you'd be able to include (if not all nutritional facts) then at least the CALORIE count for total meal? That way I could do more of your recipes but we're trying to keep an eye on calories given we are these days home bound due to the lockdown in the UK and of course we are not as active as usually so have to be a bit more careful with how much we indulge in food and your delicious inspirations. Thank you!",

				"Made this tonight - it was really great - tasted very authentic and once you have bought all the ingredients it's really easy.  Sadly didn't have the lime leaves but still tasted amazing.  Husband loved it. Will definitely be making again.",
				"I've made this with and without Kaffir leaves. I prefer with, but this is a tasty dish either way.",
				"This curry is absolutely amazing! Probably the best curry recipe I've ever made. I really liked making the paste and sauce first and steaming/ roasting the veg separately, so you could make sure they didn't get over cooked. Delicious! Thanks so much Ania! Charlotte x",
				"Hi Ania,I love your recipes but is their an alternative to coriander stalks as we are not big fans of it?",
				"Thank you for the idea of nori sheets instead of fish sauce.",
				"amazing !!!",
				"I'm not normally one to leave a post after cooking something, but I made this last night and it is freaking amazing!  The depth of flavor was shocking and I know it's only going to get better the longer it sits.  I used 4 serrano peppers (no seeds), which was way too spicy for my boyfriend, but was able to bring the heat level down by adding more coconut milk and rice.  I'll definitely make this again, but if anyone has suggestions on peppers with a similar flavor but much less heat, I would appreciate it.",
				"Cze\u015b\u0107 Ania! Thank you so much! I've only just been put on a vegan diet due to health reasons and was dreading the change until my sister introduced me to your recipes. I made the green curry and sweet potato and black bean bake. I was dubious at first and expected the food to be bland and flavourless. I have been converted! The green curry is one the best I've ever had in my life, full of punchy flavour, spice and tang! Absolutely fantastic. I'll be making a double batch of the paste next time and plan to always have some stashed in the fridge. The bake is fantastic also, never thought that vegan cheese could be so good. I'm looking forward to trying your other recipes, next on my list is the Laksa and pierogi. Can't wait. Thanks Again!CheersKuba",
				"This was a very tasty and easy recipe. I left out the tamari/soy source and  used some different veg like bell peppers, mini corn cob etc. so defiantly worth doing again.",
				"I sadly couldn't find them at my local supermarket, but I will keep looking out for them. I'm curious to see what they taste like! Also, a great excuse to make this curry again. Not that I need one. :)",
				"Made this without keffir and without blender, just chopped the ingredients really finely. I put a few strips of lemon zest in, left them in too long so the curry ended up quite bitter. Still, it was so tasty and it's so nice to use fresh herbs. Thank you!",
				"Any ideas of what to substitute if I can\u2019t get any lime leaves?  Looking forward to making this!",

I used regular pasta noodles since I don't usually purchase gluten free. I also made a double batch for my whole family. I can't wait to make this again. I've also never heard of Nutritional Yeast and read up on it. I\"m so amazed at how many vitamins and good stuff it contains. I also love the flavor. Very versatile. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!",

				"Delish with egg noodles, in particular! Second time making this almost entirely according to the recipe, which is virtually unheard of in my kitchen... I tend to wander in and out of 3-4 recipes for any given dish. Trying not to use oil so I skipped step one and used my trusty non-stick pan for a water saute, otherwise, can't think of anything to improve on or experiment with that would make this any better!",

Next time, I might try soaking the garlic in a black truffle olive oil that I love.Also, I don\u2019t leave comments often either, so it\u2019s a sign of how much I truly loved this recipe.

Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades.

I found that buckwheat flour requires more milk (approx. 600 ml / 2\u00bd cups) than plain flour or GF plain flour mix (approx. 480 ml / 2 cups), so please proceed with caution \u2013 it\u2019s easier to thin the batter than to thicken it.",

Take the pan into your hand (off the stove) and pour a thin layer of batter (I found that 80 ml / 1/3 cup of batter is optimal) into the pan and swivel it well to form a thin, round cr\u00eape. Put the pan back on the stove and cook until the cr\u00eape no longer sticks to the pan and can be flipped to the other side. Once flipped, cook the cr\u00eape on the other side for another minute or so.",

I actually mashed the chickpeas with some walnuts, salsa and spices, so it was sort of mince. We had it with salsa verde and tahini sauce. Will definitely make again! Thank you!",
				"Thank you!TBH, I feel like we should have abandoned the idea of organising a wedding in Poland after my parents, his parents objected to having an all-vegan menu and I feel like I've let them coerce me into compromising which means I'm not enjoying the preparation as much. Still mad at myself for not being assertive and decisive. Now I'm trying to fight for as many plant-based options as possible. So the vegan dinner option will be by default vegan and people can opt in to a non-vegan dinner. It's far from ideal and I wish I could turn back time and the wedding was a casual affair with a vegan food truck in Berlin... But anyway - thank you for your detailed response and all the tips!I'm just now in the process of translating various recipes for the chef and I think your Christmas roast wellington from last year would be ideal in terms of attainability of ingredients and it sounds like a delicious recipe even though I haven't tried it, I might make it this week - would it be okay for me to give the chef your recipe?Ordering some vegan sushi for the buffet could actually be a great idea...! The wedding will be 2,5 hrs from Krakow so it'd be easy to get the sushi to the venue. Never been to Youmiko, I have to go there next time I'm back home :) Thanks again and have a lovely Sunday!Basia xx",
				"These look divine! Is on my to-be-cooked list :) but more as a snack than breakfast! Hopefully the hospital visit went well.Ania (and Duncan), I was wondering if I could ask you for some advice. I'm getting married in Poland this summer and the food is giving me anxiety (as a vegan). I really want the main course to stand out. What would you cook/ request to be cooked? The most challenging thing is that some ingredients aren't as available as the are in the UK...I hope you don't mind me asking and invading the comment section - I do see you as an expert!"

				"Thanks for this amazing recipe Ania...I'm going to try it tomorrow but needed a suggestion...what could I replace maple syrup with ? Don't have it ready at hand and also do you think dry roasting the nuts would be a good idea ???Thanks Ritu ( Mumbai )",
				"Ania, these bars are amazing.  I have made them many times now and they are easy, fool proof  and delicious!  I use rice malt syrup instead of maple syrup and occasionally LSA instead of flaxseed meal and sometimes I swap out the nuts and seeds depending on what I have at the time, so it's easily adaptable . Thank you for sharing your beautiful recipes.",

				"Hi Anita. These look delicious. I hate the taste of flaxseed. Would ground  chia seeds work instead, or do you have any other suggestions? Thanks",
				"Hi Ania, I just found your blog after searching for gluten free seed bread.  You are very talented and I love your recipes.  I'm also originally from Krakow, but I live in Canada now.  I look forward to seeing more of your recipes. papa,  Ola.",

				"Hello, i just have 1 question. After cooling in the fridge overnight, does the torte need to be stored in the fridge or is this just for cooling? Thank you",

				"I made this yesterday using cherry brandy as I didn't have any amaretto. It is delicious, so rich and chocolatey and boozy.  I will definitely make this again, thank you for a brilliant recipe!",
				"Absolutely amazing. Really delicious. Loved it a lot.",
				"Thank you for your great recipes! I really love them! I can\u2019t find any silken tofu where I live. They only sell firm tofu hier in stores. Could I use these instead of silken tofu? Thanks!!",
				"Hi, my son is allergic to peanuts and all tree nuts and eggs. Can you post a recipe of this nut free? I would love to see some more nut free recipes on your site. We love your eggless banana cake!",
				"Hi Ania I'm looking to try this soon but I can't find Almond Meal in the UK could I use almond flour or ground almonds instead?",
				"Hi Ania,I can't reply to your comment for some reason but I wanted to let you know that this freezes and defrosts perfectly. I defrosted it in the fridge overnight and couldn't tell the difference from when it was fresh. My family devoured the 'test' one I made so I've just baked another one for my friend!It's delicious made with cashew butter and I love the almondy kick!Thanks for an amazing recipe :D",
				"So I decided to make this on a Sunday evening when my Monday-eve blues were in full effect - essentially the chocolate cravings were strong. This cake is intense. It is not for the faint of heart. You want something rich? Something full of chocolate goodness? Something so wonderful you feel like you need not eat anything sweet for the rest of the week? - This cake has got you covered. SUPER easy to make and full flavour points through and through. I served mine about 15-20min after being out of the oven when it was still warm with some vegan vanilla ice cream. Although after leaving it in the fridge for a day or so it is still awesome. I even took a little into work and the general rating was about 13 out of 10 stars.Awesome Ania!!",
				"Coconut yoghurt - great idea! Thank you :-)",
				"This looks absolutely delicious! I have been looking for a dessert idea for a friend who is coeliac and this will be perfect.Could you use other nut butters such as cashew butter?Can it be frozen and defrosted without affecting the texture? If not, how long will it keep please?Thanks Ania!P.S. I arrived at the Stroud Vegan Fair too late to catch your talk - please keep us all updated with any others you are planning to attend in the Bristol area! Good luck with your house move too.",
				"Looks great - thank you! Can you let me know what kind of cream you created? I am trying to find something other than coconut cream (which can be overpowering) or any of the very chemical-heavy cream substitutes you buy in the shops? I look forward to baking this.",
				"This torte is absolutely stunning! And it looks so fudgy and decadent ;)",
				"Ooh, will be making this today with the last of our summer raspberries. Thank you from another amaretto lover!",
				"Hi, Ania. My husband and I can\u2019t do tofu or any soy products for health reasons. Is there an acceptable paleo or another vegan replacement for this recipe by chance? Thanks!"

The whole house smelled tantalizing and mom said they bring back memories of cookies she had as a child, but greatly improved. I asked my dad to contribute something to this review, but he's too busy eating the cookies to review them...I'm so grateful for this recipe. I almost never casually bake anymore because of my severe osteoarthritis in my hands. I'm excited to know I can make such lovely cookies with low labor, so thank you so much. P.S.

I also used twice as many brussel sprouts as suggested.  Both changes worked out great.  This recipe is a keeper.",

I cut out one pan by instead adding the garlic infused oil to the sprouts (once the sprouts were cooked), then adding the rest of the ingredients to that pan along with the drained pasta. Like another commenter I needed a lot more liquid, about 3/4 cup of pasta water. Very nice and will keep it on rotation! I think shredded cabbage would be really nice instead of sprouts - same flavour and would cling to the spaghetti.",

				"Made this recipe tonight and it was delicious.  The only modification I made was to add chicken sausage because I had it on hand.  I saut\u00e9ed it in the pan for a few minutes before the garlic oil (I pulled it out and then added it back with sprouts).  I was in need of a new recipe and this will be in the regular rotation for sure!  Thank you.",
				"this recipe is really good.  my husband and i both love roasted brussel sprouts!  we do have a comment or question, though.  the recipe calls for 2 tbsps of oil, 1 tbsp of the pasta water and the juice of half of a lemon.  we have made this a few times, but we always have to adjust because that amount of liquid just doesn't seem to cut it, especially when you throw in the 2 tbsps of bread crumbs.  we often find this when trying new recipes.  it will call for so little liquid that if you followed it to a T, the only result would be a big bowlof pasta just stuck together.  your comments would be appreciated.  thanks! chris",

				"looks delicious! do you not cook the vegetables at all before serving?",
				"Made this tonight for dinner. Was yummy with great flavours,  but took me over an hour to make the soup and prep the veggies and tofu etc. My blender didn\u2019t make a smooth paste initially so I scooped out all of the chunky bits after simmering for 30 mins, re-blended them once soft and added back in before adding the coconut milk. Seemed to work fine!",
				"Just need to clarify, is it 2 tbsp oil for the paste, and another 2 tbsp oil for frying the paste?And also it's the white part of the lemongrass that is for blending into paste?Thanks! Looking forward to trying it out! :)~",
				"I don't usually leave comments on blogs like this, but I just have to say that this is phenomenal. Possibly one of the best things I've ever made. Thank you so much for taking all the time to make this recipe both vegan and perfect!",
				"I've never made a laksa before, let alone a vegan one, so I went into this with low expectations which were totally blown away! I think this recipe does a really good job at hitting very close to that authentic laksa soup flavour. It's a bit of a process to put together if you've never made it before (I'm sure I'll do better next time), but it turned out way better than I was expecting and was really enjoyable.Thanks so much for the recipe. xx",
				"I made this last week and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it ever since - hands down the best meal I\u2019ve ever made so thank you!!! The flavours are jsut so perfectly balanced. I was so in love with it I decided to make it again tonight but it lacked the same creamy velvety consistency  and  after much head scratching I realised it had to be the brand of coconut milk - so word of caution: not all coconut milks are created equal. Here in Aus you can get \u2018lite\u2019 or \u2018premium\u2019 coconut milk and between the brands of the \u2018premium\u2019 variety the fat content varies from 12-23%/100 grams and 40-90% pure coconut content - so be sure to get the fattiest , most coconut filled version you can find otherwise it ends up far too liquidy and spicy. Also here we call green/spring onions shallots so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been using for the paste (which has still turned out great!!) \ud83d\ude02 but excited to go buy some actual \u2018shallots\u2019 next time. Aside from my now thorough education on the discrepancies of coconut milk - I love using vermicelli in place of thicker rice noodles!!",
				"We had this laksa at the weekend and it was genuinely delicious!! Definitely adding this to our regular rotation of meals :) so yum xxx",
				"What an amazing recipe! Easy to find ingredients and easy to follow. I messed up by putting the dried spices in with the food processor blend but it still came out full of flavour. I can\u2019t wait to make this again, thank you :)",
				"This is my favourite vegan laksa recipe and I use it a lot! It's the closest recipe I've found to the bowls of laksa I had in Malaysia. I often add kafir lime leaves, crunchy noodles and Thai pickled greens and also eat this as a laksa/Khao soi hybrid and it's great.",
				"This was SO good!!!",
				"I absolutely loved this recipe! I followed it to the letter and it was just perfect! The spices really came through. The recipe was very easy to follow, so no stress in the kitchen. And I finally had an excuse to try pak choi for the first time! Thank you for sharing x",
				"Love this, made it tonight and so yummy! Added some fish sauce as I'm not vegan which was really nice.",
				"Wow! I made this exactly as set out here and I have to say it came out beautifully!!",
				"Hi :) love this recipeHow long can the paste be kept in the fridge xx",
				"I made this with store bought curry paste and added fresh lemon grass, chili flakes, garlic and some frozen lime leaves to the broth. And topped it with steamed broccoli, cilantro, spring onion and pan fried tofu, it was so delicious!",
				"I hope I can use the mandarine zest instead of lemongrass stalks.And happy to see your page since I've been desparating to seek vegan laksa recipe!Thanks for sharing your idea Ania :)",
				"Amazing and fresh with punch!  Made this tonight and it was my favourite laksa recipe.",
				"This recipe is amazing! The broth is so flavourful. Highly recommend to everyone! Would omit some of the chillies though if your not keen on food being quite spicy \ud83d\ude0a",
				"This recipe was so yummy! I made it the \u201clazy\u201d way with store bought vegan red curry paste, so I can\u2019t wait to make the laksa paste as per the recipe next time. Such a great recipe to use up some fridge veg - I added some mushrooms, julienned peppers and carrot ribbons as well as the greens!",
				"Oh no I accidently put the dry spices into the paste when I blitzed it up, do you think this will matter too much??  Or should I start over? Thanks : )",
				"yes thanks for the quick reply",
				"hello im confused about the paste do i blend the white or non-white parts of the lemongrass? this looks delicously and I cant wait to make it.",
				"I made this for dinner tonight and it was very delicious! Thank you for your recipe.",
				"Absolutely phenomenal recipe! Just made it for my boyfriend and his parents for dinner and they all said it tasted amazing!",
				"Very nice",
				"Hi there! This recipe sounds so delicious! I cannot wait to give it a try! I know this may sound a bit weird but Is there a way to make the sauce a bit thicker? I really like a thick sauce/ broth lol! Thank you!",
				"Really tasty and satisfying to make and eat!I\u2019m very grateful for this recipe, it\u2019s my go to when I\u2019m feeling run down!",
				"Made this tonight and it was a family favourite. I read another comment on the recipe about not adding the nori and I agree, it isnt really needed but I also did try it with nori and it was still lovely.",
				"I just made this last night and it was amazing. Thanks so much for the recipe!!",
				"Wow. Just made this and wow! No lemongrass or lime on hand but still yum!! Sadly nothing interesting to put in it other than ramen and tofu.",
				"My paste ended up being really bitter; any thoughts on why that would be? I ended up diluting it by adding more sugar, salt, and water, but I would've loved to have kept more of the original flavor.",
				"Looks gorge! Can you freeze it with all its toppings?",
				"Sounds delicious! Do you know how money calories per serving this has? :)",
				"If you\u2019re looking for the best Laska recipe,  just stop and make this one. This was SO GOOD! The flavor was exactly what I wanted- I was not expecting this to be as amazing as it was ( in a good way!) Awesome recipe. I\u2019ve been making curries for years, and this one is the best by far. My small changes- I used spaghetti squash instead of noodles ( I cooked it separately, I didn\u2019t want them getting soggy) I used kombu instead of nori, added  it with the extra lemongrass pieces and took them out at the same time, too. Next time I\u2019ll roast some cashews to add to the toppings. This recipe is bookmarked! Thanks Ania! Excited to see what other recipes you have on here!",
				"This looks delicious. Here in Australia I have been using vegan fish sauce which would be perfect to supply that  flavour you\u2019re looking for. I found it in the local Asian food store. You should surely be able to find it in the UK.Anyway lovely recipes and always beautifully styles",
				"Just wanted to say that I'm also up for a record breaking amount of dental treatments in Krakow in February which I\u2019m not looking forward to :(This recipe looks lovely - I might make it today!",
				"Hi Satya and AniaHave you considered putting the ingredients into some app such as MyfitnessPal as this will often give you the breakdown. I manually add into Recipes, putting in the number of portions I expect to get",
				"Hello Ania,I love your recipe's simple or elaborate doesn't bother me, you are amazing and give us such amazing concoctions. I was wondering if you would consider breaking down some of the nutritional values in your creations, I have a problem in that I am diabetic and need to count for instance both calories and carbs, in order to dose my meds with.  Otherwise I have to just shoot from the hip and guess.  The laska soup looks amazing and I have to be careful to get a reasonable amount of carbs because my body uses this for energy, and takes energy from my muscles, while I have this challenge.I count my calories because I am gradually cutting them to a healthy level for weight loss which helps me eventually overcome the diabetes, as I am type 2.I do understand it could be hard to do this and I would do it, only I don't know how to begin getting the nutritional values, maybe if you know you could direct me to finding out how to do that, if this would not suit your schedule, I know I am asking a lot, and it's time consuming.Thank you for your consideration xoxoxSatya",
				"OMG, outstanding!!!! We served it with lime wedges as well as all the other suggested toppings, and also offered chili garlic sauce :-) completely, amazingly perfect! PS, we left out the nori, we felt it really wasn't needed but would probably also be great with it!",
				"Hi Ania, \ud83d\udc89hope they're giving you plenty of local anaesthetic! Is the Polish NHS better than Britains's?",
				"Hi Ania Me again lol. I made your wellington at Christmas. Very good I fancy making this creamy  laksa but I don\u2019t like coconut. Could I replace the coconut milk with yoghurt do you think? Many thanks Julie",
				"I ove your blog.  It has so many interesting recipes and ideas.  It isn't always easy to fine tasty vegan recipes to fit many tastes and diet restrictions.  This helps so much to have such a variety.  Thanks."

Thank you for the nourishing yet interesting recipes!",

We used pearl barley, and tossed carrots and potatoes in paprika because I've never seen harissa. Also put some of Ikea's veggie balls on top. Absolutely phenomenal. The pomegranate seeds and olives were perfect in the dish. Thanks again!",
				"yummmm! Love roasted carrots! So good!",
				"I agree with your points. I will also be trying the recipe.Thank you for sharing your thoughts and talents.",

				"I appreciate your thoughts. Speaking out is one of the critical steps to resisting the hate. I have been reading articles on the murder and your thoughts give context. The world is a scary place right now. And the best we can do is hold on to our values, and resist where and how we can. For many reasons being a vegan is a good statement of values. So here is to changing the world one Buddha bowl at a time. I am looking forward to trying your recipe! It looks wonderful!"

				"Very tasty! My non-vegan partner absolutely loved it; he said it was spicy and unctuous, haha",
				"Yummm! This was delicious. I added a portobello mushroom because I only had 8oz tempeh. Used a very hot jalapeno pepper. Followed the recipe to a T otherwise. Will definitely make this again. Thank you!",
				"Thank you for this recipe! I've been intimidated making a vegan version of this until I came across your recipe and could taste everything coming together nicely after reading the ingredients. Unfortunately I was missing a ton of ingredients but thankfully had decent subs available in my kitchen to scrap this together (no thanks to the quarantine and limited shopping) . Just a warning, you'll have a good laugh at all the subs but this totally turned out!!! We have to use what we have right?? So, I just ran out of tempeh.. :'(tempeh -> 1:1 Tofu: Impossible Beefshallots -> half small red onionlime juice -> old lemon juice that's still good but not as good as fresh lime (tasted a tad bitter) + rice wine vinegartamari -> 1:1 low sodium soy sauce: vegan hoisin saucecoconut sugar -> \"premium sugar\" that was light brown colored brought back from Japan. The label is all in Japanese. It's mild in taste like coconut sugar and all I have left in the pantry sitting next to dates....oil: coconut oilThanks to your ratios, the savory, tangy and sweet balanced out perfectly, which is  key! If it weren't for my fresh herbs, I don't think I could have pulled this off to satisfy my laab craving. I look forward to making this again another time with the actual ingredients you have listed! Thank you!!",
				"Hi Ania, I have been vegan for 5 years.  I cook extensively and am frequently trying new recipes.  I have cooked a number of great recipes from your site, all of which have been great.  This vegan larb recipe is  exceptionally good.   It has a great texture and flavor.  The browned rice gives it a wonderful crunch and flavor.  It is definitely going into my permanent vegan collection of recipes.  Thank you",
				"We made this laab today! Thank you so much - it was really superb! Substituted lemon juice for lime and maple syrup for sugar. Also served it with raw courgetti tossed in lemon juice, salt and oil.It transported us back to happy holidays in Laos visiting our daughter who lived there for a couple of years. Will be following you closely from now on! xx",
				"This looks delicious, I love Thai food. But could I use tofu rather than tempeh? I can't stand the stuff. Thanks  :)",
				"Thank you, this was so good! It was also surprisingly straightforward, when I first read the recipe I thought it seemed like it would require more time than it did. Thank you so much, the flavours are really great, this will definitely become a regular use for tempeh in my house.",
				"Thank you for the recipe, it looks great and I'm going to give it a go tonight! Was just curious as to what the ground rice does in this recipe? Have never come across this before:)Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania, Great recipe! It reminded me so much of my trip to south east asia. The flavours are spot on. Keep those Original recipes coming! Best regards from snow Netherlands"

				"Hi, this looks amazing and I can't wait to make it. I have a question though, whenever I cook legumes and tomatoes together the legumes always stay crunchy and don't get tender. I think it is because of the acidity in the tomatoes seizing them up, combined with the particulars of my tap water. I was wondering if you could suggest how to modify the recipe so the raw lentils aren't added with tomatoes. Thanks!"

Unfortunately I had following problems, which I hope you can give tips to overcome the next time:) The base after taking out of the fridge and being left to get to room temperature seemed very dry and hard to roll out. During baking, as soon as the parchment with beans has been removed the base all cracked (perhaps the oven heath's up more than set up?). After baking it turn out to be kind of chewy?I had also problem with the filling, which didn't want to set, even with a blast in the freezer - did set some, but not enough to comfortably slice the cake). - What am I doing wrong?

				"This is an AMAZING recipe! I love the combination of gingerbread and chocolate, and was very intrigued by how it would work with amaretto. It\u2019s a wonderful combination of flavors. My non-vegan family loved it, too. I made the recipe as written with just a few adjustments due to my intolerances: gluten-free flour, flax egg instead of aquafaba, no nutmeg, and oat creamer in place of both the coconut cream and almond milk. I also warmed the oat creamer and mixed in the amaretto and maple syrup (to gently warm) to make sure my chocolate didn\u2019t seize. I added fresh cranberries and candied orange slices on top as decoration. I usually have a terrible time with gluten-free crusts, but this one actually worked incredibly well\u2014zero issues! I have dough leftover from the crust and am very excited to make gingerbread cookies with it. Thank you so much for this recipe!",
				"Good lord! I made this dessert for our Xmas dinner today and it was a huge success! Delicious, indulgent, the base is so crisp....it was very straightened to make in essence, you just need patience to allow things to chill, to melt slowly etc so it needed planning in terms of when I started it. We\u2019re not fully vegan in our house, my daughter has a cows milk allergy which led to me also giving up all dairy but I hate for her to feel left out or to have things she can\u2019t eat so wanted a dessert for everyone. We\u2019ll be making it again for sure!  Thank you thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious tart! This is my 2nd time making it and upon closer reading of the instructions I have a question about the baking step. So I bake the tart with the parchment and beans for 10 minutes, but step 11 says after 15 minutes remove the paper and beans and return to the oven. So do I initially bake for 10 or 15?

Maybe the fridge will help but will I be then able to leave it at a room temperature for some time without risking its melting? Or do you have an idea how to make it thicker? Thank you so much, it is such an inspiring recipe!",

				"Amazing recipe, so easy to make,with patience you can create the same.Had been looking for a eggless option, being a vegetarian. Really thanks appreciate. Wish you lots of success and do create more.",
				"I made these for my son to hand out to his classmates after his presentation on Italy. We have a lot of food allergies in our house - gluten and egg included - but my son recently outgrew his almond allergy, so we were so excited to try this recipe. I flattened ours a bit with a fork and pressed some sliced almonds into the top before baking and increased the baking time by about five minutes to suit our oven\u2026and this recipe did NOT disappoint! Thank you so much for sharing it!",
				"I absolutely loved this recipe! So easy to make and they came out perfect. Thanks so much for an amazing vegan ammaretti cookie recipe! You made my boyfriend very happy on his birthday \u263a\ufe0f",
				"thank you ania, for the recipe and for the quick response in the chat. love this cookies and your blog!!!!",
				"These are sensational! I baked them for gifts and I love offering something that fulfills so many food restrictions but you\u2019d never know it. I then made them for my family and they\u2019re a new family fave! First time using aquafaba and it was magical. Made once without amaretto and once with, delicious both ways. I also halved the sugar and that was perfect for us, but my family always halves sugar in cookie recipes so your mileage may vary.",
				"Once again, these cookies were a huge success! Ania\u2019s recipes are practically foolproof and never recognisably different to non-vegan versions. This is one of maybe three sites that I return to often for vegan recipes & inspiration!"

						"7. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm / 1\u2033 incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack at a slight diagonal (see photos in the post). The resulting strands of pastry will be braided at the top of our Wellington.",
						"8. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevent the Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"9. Brush the pastry with plant milk and sprinkle with coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds.",
						"10. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden. Serve with your favourite sides and the beet gravy on the side."

				"Firstly I would like to say a very thank you for our wonderful Christmas all courtesy of your recipes. We had a fantastic array of beet wellington, hasselback potatoes, almond bacon green beans and gochujang carrots. Followed by tiramisu. This was so well received by all of the family and I enjoyed the preparation too - a real bonus.",
				"Amazing! I made it today for the second time because I really love it! But it did take me cca 3 hours to make it, start to finish, and that's without gravy\ud83d\ude06. All that chopping  and measuring takes a lot of time, phew! For special occasions I will  definitely make the log and the mushrooms the day before.",
				"Yeah, the baking of the beetroot and all the chopping and just searching for stuff in the kitchen, pressing the tofu, getting the cats out of the way\ud83e\udd23... Those mushrooms though... I will try to use the processor next time\ud83e\udd23. But I did manage to clean everything in between haha!",
				"I did the prep for this on Christmas Eve which made putting it together on Christmas Day very simple. It was an eye catching centrepiece for the table on Christmas Day and was delicious. Also enjoyed  left overs cold  on Boxing Day!",
				"Did a practice run a week before Christmas and was really impressed with how straightforward yet delicious it is so obviously replicated for the big day!! Gets a big thumbs up from our family. Yum!",
				"This was too g\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0bd to be true! I made it the day before and compiled on Christmas Day. Dead easy, very impressive with the three layers and utt\ud83d\ude0drly  delicious. My new go-to!",
				"I Made ist today and the taste was really Tasty. Unfortunately ist was still like wet inside although I made everything exactly like you recommended. What can be the mistake ?",
				"Hey Ania, this looks so good! I'm making it this year and I had a quick question. What's the best way to help develop the flavours, in terms of making it the day before? I know you suggested making the filling and gravy the day before, but did you mean cooking the log or just putting everything in the blender and chilling it in the fridge?Thanks!",
				"Hi there! I don\u2019t have access to smoked tofu, only regular! How do you recommend I use regular tofu in this recipe?",
				"I made this for our main Xmas meal last year and will be making it again this year. It is honestly DELICIOUS and goes down as a huge crowd pleaser with my non vegan family. Very easy to make and super yummy.",
				"Hi I am making this for the big day this year and looking forward to it! My question is- how far in advance can I make it? I would ideally like to make before Xmas eve if possible as I\u2019ll be busy that day and also don\u2019t want too much to do Xmas day. You mention you can make the beet filling and the mushrooms in advance, could I do as early as 22nd Dec, then assemble on 24th and cook on 25th? Thank you! Rachel",
				"Hi AniaThis is going to be my vegan xmas dish this Christmas after reading your recipe and the reviews - so just prepping my shopping list now for it. Looks and sounds delicious. Could you just clarify though - is the beetroot required for the gravy  uncooked ?  I know for the beet mixer its already baked but just want to get it right for the gravy - thanks so much  Sophie",
				"Superb taste and quite easy to make! You'll need to plan ahead but the instructions are very easy to follow and pretty straight forward. A holiday favourite I make for a second year in a row and have convinced others to make too!",
				"Delicious ! Great for Christmas dinner. I also gave some of this to my father in law on Christmas day who is a proper meat and potato guy and not keen on anything a bit different but he really liked it so an all round pleaser. We'll be doing it again this year :)",
				"Hi Ania, I am keen to try this but have a couple of questions?1 - unfortunately I am intolerant to mushrooms. Could you suggest an alternative?2 - Would it be possible to do this without the pastry as I am struggling with pastry content at the moment?Thanks",
				"Hi Ania, This really recipe is the main part of the menu that I have come up with for a pre-Christmas dinner in 2 days time. I really like how it has something more than just simply 'a whole beetroot' as it's centre, like many other recipes. I am expecting to have it all prepped tomorrow, except, I cannot find smoked tofu anywhere. Other than a couple of years ago trying to make somewhat of a disasterous cheesecake with tofu, I have not cooked with it and I don't usually eat it either. In fact, I really don't know one type of Tofu from the next. Can you please tell me whether the other flavours are strong enough to carry the recipe with a plain Tofu, or do I need reassess? I'm hoping time difference allows you to see this before I need to get cooking. Thank you",
				"Hi Ania, please tell me if I can freeze this gorgeous Wellington in its pastry?",
				"HI! This looks amazing :-)Do you think it could be prepped the day before and left in the fridge till baking?Thank you!",
				"Made this last night. Ah man the flavours are insanely good. Two questions though: Any ideas why the beet meat part wasn't as red as yours? (I added in about 20% more beet than suggested) And it wasn't as firm to shape as yours was, it kind of spread out in the oven. Any ideas? Otherwise 10 out of 10 forks on the taste meter.",
				"Hi! Thanks so much for replying :) . I did use vacuum-sealed, so that explains it. I'll use your recipe amount this time so it holds together like yours does.. Thanks so much again, about to make it now for Christmas dinner",
				"Made this last Christmas after looking at loads of recipes and it was so good going to make it again this year!  Really lovely flavours with smoked tofu, beets and mushroom.   Looks really impressive but is actually really straightforward to make.  Thank you for sharing the recipe x",
				"My go-to for all fancy/special occasion roast dinners, and sometimes mid-week in the winter too \ud83d\ude0dThe first couple of times I made it without the walnuts and then the third time I added them - Just wow! You gotta add them if you have them in your pantry! I haven\u2019t found Vegan Puff anywhere near me so I make my own shortcrust pastry and wrap it in that. It works perfectly! Easily my favourite vegan recipe ever \ud83d\udc95",
				"I made this last year (Xmas 2020) and it was a winner. It's fun to make, looks fantastic on the table both before and after cutting it, and the taste is out of this world, especially the light-handed smokiness from the tofu.We're having it again this year, so I've already made the beetroot mix and the mushroom mix and they're in the freezer, so all I'll have to do on the day is assemble it all. Thank you so much for such a lovely recipe.",
				"This will be our 3rd year making this! It is SO delicious! I do have a question, though. I\u2019m wondering if you can prepare and freeze the tofu \u201clog\u201d in advance. Then thaw it in the fridge and prepare the rest of it the day of. Thanks for such an amazing recipe!!",
				"HI Jenae, Ive made both the mixes in advance but kept them separate in the freezer. I don't know if that will make any difference but I didn't want to risk the two mixes mushing into each other as/after they're defrosted..",
				"Hi Ania, I have a question, I really want to cook a vegan mushroom wellington for christmas but I was wondering, which would be better refill : tofu, seitan or tempeh? I never tried any of these for the moment and I m really looking for a \"meat\" taste, kinda shawarma refill... Could you help me?! My Christmas menu will definetly be based on your recipies... Thx for sharing.",
				"Thank you for this recipe. Made it for my small group of dear friends and we all just LOVED it! It was worth all the work and you made it so clear who to do it. This one will be on our Dutch table again, that's for sure.",
				"Wow! What can I say, this recipe is absolutely spot on! I\u2019ve been wanting to try a Wellington for a while but always been a bit intimidated by the prospect, but this is a perfect step by step guide - everything worked exactly as described, and the photos of how to braid the pastry were so helpful!  Even the fussy non-vegan at my dinner party went back for seconds, and I\u2019ll definitely be doing it again for Christmas. Many thanks!!",
				"Hi! Love this recipe! Just wondering if tou need the nutritional yeast or is it just for  added nutrition?Thanks!",
				"So do delicious!!! I didn't do the sauce and had only half of the mushrooms and still it was incredibly tasty. It looks like it is complex but it's easy to follow the steps and with ingredients so easy to get... You made it easy to impress people with a fancy and delish dish without too much work \ud83d\ude09",
				"I made this beet Wellington for my Easter dinner and the non meat eaters and it was such a hit! It was actually the meat eaters favorite dish too!! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Absolutely delicious!  Most recipes that require some more work are prone for errors, but this one turned out right the first time I made it.As I didn't have enough mushrooms, I ended up mixing half of the vegetables from the gravy with the duxelles, after mincing them in the food processor.The result was amazing, it maybe even added some more taste to the duxelles. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",
				"Hi Ania, I have yet to make anything from your site that hasn't been incredibly tasty and rich and thought out! I made this for Christmas just past, and oh my goodness. It was D E L I C I O U S. This was my first Christmas after committing fully to veganism, and I wanted to make a dish that meant I didn't feel like I was missing out at Christmas dinner. Boy oh boy was I glad I chose this. I did as you suggested and made the gravy the day before, resulting in such a full flavour! And the leftovers... I was eating Wellington for days - and it just kept getting better! Hehe thank you for your tasty skills and for sharing all of them with us :) Erin",
				"This recipe is amazing! I made it for our main Christmas dinner and it went down an absolute treat. My dad for one isn't vegan (though he doesn happily eat the veggie and vegan meals I make a few times a week) and he even said it was \"superb\"! Thank you for sharing this fantastic meal :)",
				"I wish I could post a photo- this came out exactly like the photos on the website- and it was just delicious! My husband  was over the moon about it! Thank you!",
				"My husband and I have been following a vegetarian eating plan for almost two years now and I wanted to find something special to make for our New Year's Day dinner when I found this recipe. I spent the afternoon making the components and look forward to assembling it tomorrow - I think it is going to be amazing! Thank you!",
				"THANK YOU ANIA!!!I made this for Christmas dinner (instead of our usual seitan wellington.)It was DELICIOUS!!!!Savory and beautiful.Instead of smoked tofu, I opted for extra firm tofu and liquid smoke. We loved the subtle smoky beet flavor.It was a hit!I will definitely make this again!",
				"Really good flavour and looks lovely. It was a hit with the non-vegans this Christmas too! I didn't try the gravy as I already had some pre-made but followed the rest to the letter and it worked beautifully. Thank you!",
				"We  made this for Christmas dinner today and it was absolutely lovely; visually beautiful ,delicious and nutritious\u2014 the holy trinity.  Your instructions were perfect and the beautiful photos were an enormous help.  Thanks for yet another wonderful recipe.  Hope you and those you love have a  healthy and beautiful new year.",
				"This was my second making this dish. First time, I hadn\u2019t bought enough mushrooms so used spinach instead. It was great both times (though I prefer the mushrooms). Skipped the gravy both times, and sprinkled toasted slivered almonds on top. Great leftover too!",
				"Just made this for Christmas lunch. It was way more tasty than I expected! My non-vegan husband loved it also (he gobbled down most of it). We are definitely making this again!",
				"Dear AniaWe just made this for our vegan christmas dinner and it is an absolutely amazing dish; so flavourful and delicious! We had the good fortune of discovering your blog in the last few months and every dish we tried without fail is delicious and flavoursome; your creativity and dedication shines through in all of the recipes in the blog and we look forward to tasting them all some time! Thanks so much for making such delicious dishes accessible to us all, and keep up the amazing work!Anand",
				"incredible and even more tasty than what I could imagine!!",
				"Dear Anja. This Wellington recipe is the best! I have been making it for 3 years in a row for Christmas and I am always looking forward to it for weeks. It is just so unbelievably delicious. Usually I make a ridiculous amount of food on the 24th and then eat leftovers for the next two days in my pyjamas :D; this year I made two batches of your amazing Wellington so now I'm set for the next few days. Thank you so much for this beautiful festive recipe. It has become part of my Christmas tradition.",
				"I was wondering if there was any substitute for mushrooms? I\u2019mIntolerant and it\u2019s so hard the find a recipe without mushrooms. Thank you!",
				"We live in a remote area and I've never seen smoked tofu in our grocery store. Do you think a few drops of liquid smoke could be used with plain tofu? Thanks!",
				"Hi,I am thinking to make this for my veggie housemate at Christmas but he has a nut allergy. Do you think I could replace the walnuts with chestnuts which are apparently OK?I think I will need to make ahead and freeze the components due to time and kitchen space pressures",
				"This was incredible. A proper feast!!! I\u2019m glad I made all the components the day before. I think that\u2019s a must-do for this recipe, at least with a busy family in the house. It\u2019s a bit of work, but the rewards are huge! Absolutely delicious.",
				"I really like the idea of using a pre-baked beetroot filling (rather than just whole beetroot/squash), but I would really like to avoid using tofu. Do you think there's a possible replacement? Perhaps a some sort of grain or beans that I could use instead? Thank you!",
				"Hello AnitaI am cooking for a vegan at Christmas as well as six non.vegans.  This recipe looks wonderful but can I prepare it in advance and leave it uncooked in the fridge or freezer ?",
				"Woah, what a stunner!!I've made this Wellington for Christmas (all non-vegans except me) and it was a complete hit! The beetroot flavor is not prominent at all, the flavors are very well combined and nicely finetuned.I added a tsp of plum jam to my gravy, as my grandmother does ;) Worked out nicely.This is a wonderful dish for festive and special occasions.Love it :)"

						"2. Place the ground poppy seeds in a medium size bowl and bring the almond milk to a gentle boil. As soon as it boils, pour it over the poppy seeds and cover the bowl with an upside down large plate. Set aside for 15 minutes for the poppy seeds to soften.",
						"3. Mix in the coconut oil (it should melt right in), coconut cream, sugar (I ground it up a little bit too), cinnamon, vanilla, chopped raisins, nuts, candied orange and ground up chia (or flax) seeds. Mix everything really well and set aside in the fridge, to thicken."
					]

					"DOUGH": [
						"1. Place the sifted flour, yeast, turmeric, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Mix well.",
						"2. Add the lukewarm plant milk and mix it into the dry ingredients with a spoon.",
						"3. Next, mix in the melted (but not hot) coconut oil.",
						"4. Once a rough dough forms, knead it for 10 minutes like you would knead bread. Initially, the dough may appear too oily, but soon enough the excess oil will get absorbed by the flour and the dough will become easier to handle. Sprinkle the kneading surface with a little more flour if it\u2019s too sticky.",
						"5. Once you are done kneading and the dough is elastic and smooth, place it in a bowl and cover it with a kitchen towel. Set aside in a warm place for 1.5-2 hrs, until it doubles in size.",
						"6. Just before you are ready to roll out your dough, heat up the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.",
						"7. Once the dough has doubled in size, roll the dough out into a large, 3 mm thick rectangle.",
						"8. Spread the filling on the surface of the rolled out dough leaving a 2 cm margin on all sides.",
						"9. Roll the dough up into a log and then wrap it in a long (it should be long enough to go around the log twice) strip of baking paper, leaving an index finger wide gap between the log and the paper so that the cake is able to rise a little.",
						"10. Bake for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, cut the baking paper off and allow the log to cool off.",
						"11. Apply the icing to the warm (but not hot) cake and decorate with poppy seeds."

				"I am so excited to be finally making this! With our German roots, we love poppy seed bakes. I will be making them into mini babka shapes; hope it works.",
				"Hi! I\u2019m so excited to make this! :)Is it better if served immediately? How do you suggest storing it? Hoping to bring to a friend\u2019s house and trying to decide when I should do the baking. Thanks so much!",
				"Hi Ania! I have only active dry yeast. Would the recipe work if I let it activate as usually and then mix it with the dry ingredients?Thanks!",
				"Hi, can I make this as a nut roll instead of poppyseed? If so what changes would you recommend if any? Thanks!",
				"Weird question. I make this roll quite regularly - it is AMAZING. BUT......can you freeze it?  I just went crazy and made this and some choc cookies kind if forgetting that my hungry  (and skinny) daughter isn't here anymore!  I really shouldn't be eating sweet treats at all  and as it's just me and husband at home......well, we are now over-supplied with goodies! What do you think?  :)",
				"Tastes so similar to how my Oma used to make! Delicious recipe :)",
				"Incredible! I ground the poppy seeds in my high speed blender and then added the almond milk and blended a bit more before allowing it to sit. It worked out very well.",
				"Yum! I didn't have baking paper so mine wasn't as pretty as the photos, but that didn't effect the great taste! I also didn't have coconut cream so I used almond butter so I still had a fatty ingredient, and it seemed to work just fine! So my point is, the recipe is wonderful even if you have to change a few minor things.  I look forward to making it again. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd70",
				"Hi, I am hoping to try this recipe this week. I was wondering if any oil can be used for the dough in place of coconut oil?",
				"Going to make this for Christmas this year! Do you think it would work with whole wheat flour, buckwheat flour, or oat flour?Also, is instant yeast the same as fast action yeast (found in sachets)?Thanks.",
				"Bit of a delayed update, but I did end up making it and from what I can remember I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and it turned out fine! I think I rolled the dough a bit too thin so it cracked and splodged out a bit in the oven, but it turned out better than I expected and it was delicious. I did use \"fast action yeast\" that come in sachets. I think it's the same as what you were referring to, it just seems to have different names depending on who you ask.Just so I don't mess up - because I've forgotten what I used last year - is coconut cream the solid stuff from a can of coconut milk?Thanks for the awesome recipe.",
				"Hi Ania,Could this be baked in a loaf pan instead of using the parchment paper?  Is the paper used to keep it in the log shape, or to keep it from browning too early?Thanks,Michelle",
				"I also find it unclear what exactly needs to be done with the parchment paper. How do you wrap it exactly? Do the ends need to be covered, too? Is it wrapped tightly apart from the very top of the log?",
				"Thanks for this recipe!I have Hungarian and Serbian roots, and I was introduced to all sort of savoury dishes when I was a kid. However, for some reasons sweets weren't passed on. But I did discover poppy-based pastries on trips to Hungary and Czechia and my mind was blown! Thanks for allowing me to recreate this one. I tweaked the filling a bit and used olive oil instead of coconut for the dough and it all came pretty nicely; it's been dubbed \"the most Austrian sweet that they've had in a long time\" by an expatriate Austrian ;)The quantity of dough seemed a bit off compared to the filling, I followed the recipe instead of my instinct but I couldn't put everything inside (had to eat the remaining filling straight from the bowl, he he) and it was nowhere near 3-mm thick. I'll probably double it next time (and use it for other purposes, it's a really nice dough!).",
				"My parents are Croatian, and my mother used to make poppy seed roll at Christmas.  She hasn't made this for so many years, and I miss these types of desserts around the holidays.  I'm so happy to find this recipe and can't wait to try it!  I am going to try using dates to sweeten the filling instead of sugar.  I think the texture and sweetness of dates would complement poppy seeds really well.   Also, I just looked up poppy seeds on cronometer, and they are very high in calcium, so that's and extra bonus!",
				"EXCELLENT RECIPE! I have made this twice. I have been missing poppyseed roll so much and now I can have it again. Thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious! I did swap the candied orange for fresh lemon zest, and it still worked a treat.",
				"I do love the poppy seed roll  / cake and was able to buy it at the Preston Market from a stall that sold coffee and other Italian biscuits, cakes etc. The stall bought these rolls in from another pastry cook, who retired at the age of 80, so hence you cannot buy them anymore. I do love the walnut version, my Slovenian mother in law made them at Christmas and I wish I could have been with her when she made them, so I could make them myself, Is there any chance that you could do a vegan version of the walnut roll?",
				"I'm super excited to make this! I'm just confused about the baking in paper part. Do you put the roll into some sort of pan after you roll it in the baking paper?",
				"My partners mother and stepmother (both Slovenian) made a version of this using walnuts, any chance that you could do a recipe for this too?",
				"I bought a new packet of  the yeast you specified so I really don\u2019t know what happened! \ud83d\ude29",
				"Made this for Christmas. The filling was amazing but my dough didn\u2019t rise. But it still tasted wonderful..Any suggestions for making the dough rise. I live in a hot country so there is no problem with getting enough warmth for the dough to rise.?",
				"Hello!  Have you ever tried using a high powered blender such as Vitamix for the poppy seed grinding?  I wondered if the quantity was too small - or maybe soften in the plant milk then blend? Thanks",
				"This thing is seriously SOO delicious. Was one of the tougher things I\u2019ve ever baked (never done the kneading process before) but nevertheless my husband and I can\u2019t get enough it. Going to keep making it over and over. Thank you for this recipe!",
				"Do you think spelt flour would work?",
				"I also make this traditional Hungarian delicacy without the icing on Roland a walnut filled roll too. I am lucky to have a poppyseed grinder but there is ground poppyseeds in my local  Hungarian shop called  Paprika in Beeston Nottingham. There are branches in London Scotland and Ireland.",
				"Can this be made gluten free?",
				"Just made a Hungarian-Australian guys day : D",
				"Used to buy this from a Polish bakery in Leeds, UK,  (1980s) then from a Russian bakery in St Kilda, Australia, (1990s). Haven't had it in years so am about to bring the memories rolling back when I make this!! Thanks!!",

				"1. Pour 60 ml / \u00bc cup of water and the juice of half a lemon into the blender. Add the drained and rinsed cashews and blend.",
				"2. Taste the mixture. If you want more tanginess, add more lemon juice, otherwise add more water to get the mixture smooth, but still thick (I added 120 ml / \u00bd cup liquid in total). Season with salt and set aside in the fridge (overnight if you can, but it is not necessary!)",
				"3. Grate half of your potatoes coarsely and half very finely. Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl filled with water. This prevents discoloration and it also allows you to separate the potato starch from the potatoes easily.",
				"4. Once you are done grating, remove the potatoes from the water with a slotted spoon and place them on a fine sieve. Using the back of a spoon, keep on pressing the potato mixture into the sieve gently to allow excess water to drain away. Additionally, you may want to wrap the drained potatoes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze as much water out of them as you can. You can also use your hands and squeeze little handfuls of them instead \u2013 it\u2019s more time consuming but easier on the cleaning. This step is very important as the drier the potatoes, the crispier your latkes will be.",
				"5. Gently tip the bowl that the grated potatoes were sitting in and drain away the water to reveal a pool of potato starch set at the bottom of the bowl. Don\u2019t throw that away, we will add it to the latkes mixture to maximise crispiness.",
				"6. In a large bowl, combine the dry grated potatoes, grated onion, salt and pepper. Then add the flour and the dry potato starch that has gathered at the bottom of the bowl, making sure you don\u2019t add any water back in. Mix it up really well.",
				"7. Heat up a wok or a frying pan on the stove. Pour enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and heat up the oil. Once the oil is hot, scoop a tablespoon worth of the latkes mixture and press it between two tablespoons to make the mixture nice and compact. Lie the mixture on the hot oil (you should hear a loud sizzle as soon as the mixture hits the pan) and flatten the latke a little. Depending on the size of your pan and the size of your latkes, fry 3-4 latkes at a time.\nFry on one side for about 3-4 minutes. Do not flip the latkes over until they are browned all over on one side \u2013 you\u2019ll notice the edges will turn brown, that\u2019s the time to flip. Flip them to the other side using a flat spatula. Fry until the other side turns golden brown too (about 3-4 minutes). Remove from the pan and place on a plate lined with kitchen roll to soak away any excess oil.\nPut the ready latkes in a warm (100\u00ba C / 210\u00ba F) oven while you fry subsequent batches.\nServe warm, topped with chilled cashew sour cream.",

				"Hello AniaI love your gluten-free recipes and like you, I also LOVE latkes. To get the grated raw potatoes really dry, have you tried pressing them through a potato ricer?It is my go-to solution. I am going to try putting the potato in water to prevent discolouring. Thanks for that hint.Sarah",

				"Ok, I'll remedy that for you then... I like mine with a sprinkling of sugar and LOTS of applesauce, 'cause that's how I grew up eating them (of course, they weren't latkes, but their German cousins, Kartoffelpuffer). That is how you will typically find them at fests, too, although recently, they've started to be available with sour cream, too (if I remember correctly). Considering that applesauce was the only thing they did NOT offer at the Chicago Christmas Market, I'd say that was a serious faux-pas!",

				"So simple and yummy!",
				"Beautifully comforting and wholesome recipe! The creamy consistency and punchy spices dance joyfully across the tongue. Such a wonderful dish to celebrate the end of my exams with- I will certainly be cooking it again in the future! Thank you very much!",
				"Firstly, thank you for your blog, i enjoy your recipes.  But, could you please, for my sanity, keep to the same measurements?   Preferably grams.  I am having to look up  the weight of 1 cup chick peas, what about 1 sweet potato.? Sweet potatos have a huge size range.  Thanks x",

				"Obsessed. So simple and yummy. Wholesome, healthy. Thanks so much for this lovely recipe!",

				"This is a fantastic recipe! I served it to a non-vegan foodie who must have said 10 times how well the flavours worked together - he had seconds and then thirds to prove it! I used a tin of black eye beans as a change from chickpeas - the firm texture and nutty flavour worked  great. Many thanks Ania. I've tried several of your recipes now and very much enjoyed them all :)",
				"I made this for tea and it was a hit - even with my fussy toddler. I didn\u2019t have any curry paste so I just added some ground coriander, ground cumin, more lime juice, more turmeric and a bit of soy sauce to make up for it. Delicious - thank you!",

				"Dear Ania,this is sooooo good, yummy, delicious and great! I made it today and it was quite easy and quick to make, no rare ingredients needed. With more routine dinner will be ready in half an hour. We just added some plain tofu because we love asian food with tofu! And I will definitely have this dish regularly! \ud83d\ude42Thanks for this awesome recipe!",

I ended up doing it in my Instant Pot pressure cooker because I like to use it whenever possible :)  Just did the saute in there and then once I added the potatoes I did it for 5 minutes high-pressure. I don't eat rice or grains, so I just had it as-is kind of like a soup and the taste was very good. Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!",

				"Hi Made this curry tonight and it was very tasty enjoyed by all the family.  However I did add some prawns cause I\u2019m not vegan. Thanks for the recipe.",
				"We have just eaten this wonderful  dish, very tasty. I added some sugar snap peas as wanted to use them up. Didn\u2019t have time to cook the rice (I forgot!) so I cooked some buckwheat noodles and they seemed to work well. Will definitely cook again. Thank you",

Bake for about 15 minutes (maple syrup cookies take more time to bake, about 25 minutes), until they are lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool down before transferring to a plate (or else they may fall apart). Store in an airtight container."

				"This is an unbeatable and delicious cookies and it looks sooo yummy\u2026i will trying to making it few days later\u2026.thanks for sharing\u2026\u2026!",
				"oh my these were like vegan ferrero rocher in a cookie! Just all the amazing chocolate hazlenut fudginess possible. I made these with sugar and cooked for 15 minutes. The prep took a while because I decided to roast and skin the hazlenuts as well as making my own flour. Next time I will be preparing double the amount of nuts in order to make a double batch.",
				"Thanks for sharing! Do they keep long?",
				"This looks so good! Do you make any other kinds of cookies with a hazelnut base?",
				"Oh my goodness! I am still very new to plant based eating and these are so delicious!  A hit with everyone who has tried them (vegan or not). And aside from the sugar, they are so healthy!  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!!!!",
				"Really need to try those, sounds terrible! Thanks for sharing!",
				"Hi Ania - Would you be able to clarify the amount of chopped hazelnuts for coating the cookies vs. hazelnut meal? The way the recipe reads to me is 1/3 c. chopped hazelnuts and 2/3 ground hazelnuts PLUS 1c. hazelnut meal. But that doesn't seem right :)",
				"I made these tonight and they are terrific!",
				"Just made these and they are gorgeous!  I used maple syrup, but added a tablespoon of flax meal and only one tablespoon of aquafaba.  Mine were perfect after 15 minutes in the oven.  They look just like your picture and have a lovely, fudgy texture with deep chocolate flavor.  I used raw hazelnuts, which were fine.   Also, when I ground the nuts in the first step, I made the additional cup of hazelnut meal as well.  I think chocolate chips in the dough would not be amiss ;)  Tagging you on instagram!",
				"Do you use raw or roasted hazelnuts?",
				"i am not vegan - can i use an egg instead of the aquafaba?",
				"I will try out this recipe this week. It looks wonderful!! I also adore this flavour combination!My family is the same with the crazy  amount of work we take on at the holidays. Well, specifically my Mom used to and then me. Just in the last 2 years I\u2019ve said No. It\u2019s my holiday too and I want the opportunity to relax a little and enjoy it. You just have to let yourself off the hook of being responsible for everything. Such a relief."

Yes, I know, it does take some time!\nFinally trickle in cold water and mix it into the flour mixture with a cutlery knife.\nAdd the water very gradually as too much will make the pastry tough.

				"I\u2019ve made this again and again. I do cheat and buy a ready made vegan sweet shortcrust but the filling is just incredible. Thank you for the recipe.",
				"Made this pecan pie over the weekend. It was great!",
				"Could I use ready-made pastry instead, please? If so, which type is best? I said I'd make dessert for my first Christmas with my boyfriend and he loves pecans!",
				"I haven't had pecan pie in 35 years and decided to try this. It is by far the best pecan pie I've ever eaten.",
				"I absolutely love this fantastic pecan pie! A friend of mine who lives vegan recommended it to me a few years ago. I've made the pie three times now and the second time, I used some cheaper vanilla extract and thought I could save a few bucks. Oh boy, was I wrong! It almost ruined the flavour of this delicious aromatic pie and cost me the \"oh wow, can't believe that's vegan\" experience at the family dinner table. Never doing that again!I've found that although I halved the maple syrup on my second and third attempt, the pie is still on the verge of being too sweet (yes, even for a pie). I'll try also halving the brown sugar next time and hopefully will achieve a result that better fits my German taste buds.All the best - Tanja",
				"I quit eggs few years ago, although not vegan, being a vegetarian and egg free pretty much eliminates conventional desserts for me. I tried this pecan pie and it was unbelievable!  Not only vegan but you cannot tell the difference. It\u2019s easy, rich in flavor and really awesome texture. Everyone who ate just could not believe how amazing it was being vegan!",
				"Loved this recipe will definitely make it again!",
				"HI, I love all your recipes! I was wondering if using buckwheat flour would work?  Using the xanath gum, of course. Thanks!",
				"This pecan pie came out beautifully! My non-vegan pecan-pie-loving mom approved too!",
				"Made this today. The GF version. I couldn\u2019t find silken tofu, only firm. So I blended the quantity required  down with some almond milk to the consistency of  Silke tofu which worked fine. Absolutely divino !  The grated orange peel comes through subtly and every bite is quite heavenly packed with nuts and flavour. Effort required for the dough making well worth it ! Love love love ithis vegan pecan nut pie and ao does the rest of the family. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

				"This Pecan Pie recipe from Ania is even tastier than the original recipe from my aunt eaten 60 years ago!  Have made it several times. I only change the crust by adding  more coconut fat. And although we looove the cinnamon orange flavor, I might next time add rum and vanilla instead. \ud83d\ude09 Thank you Ania!",
				"Hello Ania,I would like to use your recipe and make this but I don\u2019t use/have/like tofu, please  tell me what I can use instead. I am not vegan. Thank you so much.",
				"This recipe was super delicious - and so quick and easy to make (I cheated and bought ready made pastry to save time). I had never had pecan pie before, combined with the fact I was making it vegan, I wasn\u2019t sure how this would turn out but everyone absolutely loved the flavours and it was a huge success with my American flatmate spending her first Thanksgiving in London. Will definitely become a regular on the dessert list!",

				"I LOVE pecan pie so thank you for this recipe.  At the same time, I am so very sorry that you got upset about trying to make great pictures.  You are to be commended for doing so much to help people become plant based - for morals, for health, for environment, for animals.  Dee",
				"Hi Ania!I ended up using it anyway and the pie came out perfect :)Everyone loved itThanks!Roi",
				"Hi :) what can replace the refined coconut oil in this recipe that won't add unwanted flavors?Thanks!",

				"I wonder if this would work well as mini tarts - I used to make mini pecan pies before I was vegan.... they look so cute  with one little pecan decorating each one..... I have been too nervous to make them since our change of diet, not sure why. But I may give it a go.... tricky bit will be estimating the bake time I reckon...",
				"Hi, can this pie be made the day ahead? If so I think it needs to go in the fridge what do you think? If you really think I shouldn\u2019t make it a day ahead,  I won\u2019t because it\u2019s for Thanksgiving and I wanted to be really great. Thanks",
				"Hello!Could you help me - what can I use instead of white flour? Is almond/tapioca/corn/oat flour OK for that? Did you try something of that?And maybe I can swap xantham gum with something?How many days can I keep it in refrigerator?Thenk you so much!",
				"Thank you for this recipe.  We have a daughter that is 99% vegan.  She is also gluten intolerant so I am thinking about swapping out the all purpose flour with pecan meal/flour to create a gluten-free option.  I have had good luck with that in the past.",

The dough was wonderful to work with and  very tasty.Instead of  almond butter I've used peanut butter for the filling... won't do it next time.  The taste of peanut butter was to dominant.Thanks for the recipe!",

			],
			"time": "90 min",
			"serving": "serves 8",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Heat up the oil in a deep frying pan / casserole pot (with a lid). Add the chopped onion and fry on a low-medium heat until translucent, stirring from time to time.",
				"2. Add the garlic, bell pepper, carrot and celery. Saut\u00e9 until softened, stirring from time to time.",
				"3. OPTIONAL STEP: Roast the jalapenos over a gas stove (or use the broiler function of your oven) using metal tongs. Turn them around so that they are charred on all sides. As soon as they are done, place them on a plate and cover them with an upside down bowl \u2013 this will trap the steam making it easier to take off the skins. Once cool, scrape the blackened skin off and dice finely \u2013 remove all (or some) of the seeds if you don\u2019t want your chilli to be very spicy.",
				"4. Add the diced jalapenos to the pot. If you haven\u2019t roasted them, deseed them first and you may want to use fewer, as roasting them makes the heat gentler.",
				"5. Add all of the spices (except for cayenne / chilli) and coat the diced vegetables in them well. Saute for a few minutes, stirring frequently.",
				"6. Add in wine and simmer for 10-15 minutes.",
				"7. Add in the plum tomatoes (squash them with a fork first as it\u2019s harder to do that once in the pot), 2 cans worth of water, a bay leaf, salt and a good pinch of pepper.",
				"8. Put the lid on and simmer for about 20 minutes.",
				"9. OPTIONAL STEP: While the sauce is simmering, toast your walnuts gently in a dry frying pan until fragrant and lightly browned. You could also do this in a 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F (no fan function) oven for 7-8 minutes, but please be vigilant as you don\u2019t want them to brown too much \u2013 they will taste bitter.",
				"10. Chop the walnuts into small pieces but don\u2019t grind them in a food processor \u2013 that\u2019s too fine. You want the individual pieces to be roughly the size of the lentils.",
				"11. Add the walnuts and dry lentils to the pan and allow them to cook for 20 minutes.",
				"12. Take the lid off to allow the sauce to thicken for 20-30 minutes.",
				"13. Add diced sweet potato about 12 minutes before the end of cooking time, when the sauce is still a little too thin for your liking.",
				"14. Once the sauce thickens, taste it and season with more salt (if needed), a touch of sweetness (if needed) and cayenne pepper (or chilli) if it\u2019s too mild for your taste.",
				"15. Finally, mix in the drained kidney beans and chocolate. You could use a tablespoon or two of raw cacao if you wish, but it will add bitterness to the dish so make sure you counteract that with a bit more sweetness from sugar / date syrup or maple syrup.",
				"16. Serve on cooked rice, cauliflower rice or quinoa, topped with vegan yogurt and fresh coriander. Be aware that this dish, as is the case with all stews, tastes even better the day after it has been made, so I recommend making it a day in advance. It also freezes well."

Jalape\u00f1o sauce  instead  of fresh and used passata as no tins tomatoes then served with bulgar wheat and quinoa. Well deffo cook again thank you.",

						"1. PLEASE NOTE that this recipe yields 1\u00bd cups of frosting, enough to ice two cakes, but I do not recommend halving it as this is the smallest amount the blender can handle.",
						"2. Put all the liquid ingredients: coconut cream, maple syrup, lemon juice and vanilla extract at the bottom of the blender.",
						"3. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my average blender, this is the only way I can achieve a smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.",
						"4. Add about a quarter of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth then add another quarter and process until smooth. Continue until you\u2019ve added all the cashews.",
						"5. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe to turn the cashews into a smooth and creamy frosting.",

						"3. Sift the flour and the remaining dry ingredients into a smaller bowl and mix well. Alternatively, you could sift them straight into the wet ingredients, but make sure you combine everything thoroughly.",
						"4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones in three batches, mixing well each time.",
						"5. Mix until there is no dry flour left, but do not overmix (that\u2019s only important if you are using a flour containing gluten)!",
						"6. Fold half the pecans into the cake batter gently.",
						"7. Transfer the batter into the prepared baking tin. It should be fairy thick.",
						"8. Bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out fairy clean (this cake should be moist). Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool down completely before removing from the tin and applying the frosting.",

				"Amazing recipe, tried it multiple times already and it's definitely foolproof!For the next time, I'd like to make it with less/no sugar as I'm using another type of artificial sugar - now my question: Is the sugar necessary for anything else but the sweet taste? E.g. to hold it all together, etc.? Thank you in advance :)",
				"Hi Ania, I've been cooking from your recipes for quite some time now and thought I'd finally leave a reply. I absolutely adore this bread! The flavour reminds me of Dutch Kruidnoten, which I haven't had in a long time, so I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing pumpkin bread. The consistency is just perfect (I used buckwheat flour), it's all very well balanced. Will definitely be making this more often! It also freezes very well, which is a plus as I would otherwise eat it all in a day or two..Just a wee question, do you reckon I could use pumpkin seeds in stead of pecan nuts, or is there something else nut free that you could recommend?  I'll be making this for friends, hopefully soon, but it has to be nut free. Thank you so much for all your amazing recipes!",
				"Just made it yesterday and this recipe is definitely a keeper! It looks great even without the frosting, it's moist and easy to make (I roasted my pumpkin). Had only cane sugar so subbed the original suggestion for that (much less sugar went in as cane sugar is sweeter). Thank you Anita for sharing another great recipe!",
				"I made the pumpkin bread with buckwheat flour and half the sugar and it was delicious. The addition of cardamom makes this loaf really special. I\u2019m always looking for recipes using it. Lovely addition to a cup of tea as autumn rolls in.",
				"This recipe is truly amazing.  I made it with just the 3/4 cup sugar and 100g pecans as i find it a bit to nutty for me.  This is a keeper it freezes well.  Did not make the frosting and i must say with a cup of something hot and a nice slice of this bread good way to start the day.  Thanks",

Was very happy with the crumb, one of the best I have made. Query: never used coconut sugar, used regular sugar because that is what I had on hand. Is coconut sugar much sweeter than regular sugar? I missed the  taste of salt.. Could I add some? Would definitely make again.",

				"I just tried these with buckwheat flour -- they were good, but when I do this again I'm going to do a different flour than Buckwheat because they came out a little dark and dense. I think a lighter flour might have yielded better results, but they were yummy so I will try again!",
				"I made these pumpkin pancakes for breakfast today , had to make  some slight variations to suit what was in the cupboard. I used tahini instead of almond butter (I imagine the flavour would be quite different with almond butter though). I also used 1/2 plain gf flour and 1/2 buckwheat flour as that is what I had on hand. Regardless of alterations they were delicious.Thanx for sharing",

				"this sauce was delicious, and the flat smelt wonderful too. I added in some sage as I had some to use up.",

				"Great for a grey winter day!   Delicious just a little too much chilli  and smoked paprika for us (sadly I live with anti spicy/chilli parents!) but I will know for next time . . there will definitely be a next time : )",
				"You are so welcome! Sort I didn\u2019t see where to rate the recipe at the bottom but I\u2019d say it\u2019s 5 stars!",
				"I loved this. Thank you so much! I didn\u2019t have dried shitake mushrooms so I just chopped more fresh in addition to the chestnut mushrooms. I had a bit of umami spice ( from Trader Joe\u2019s grocer  in America ) so I added that into a cup of vegetable stock to make up for the mushroom water. I added a bay leave as well. I think next time I might throw the mushrooms in a food processor with a bit of firm tofu to create more of a crumble consistency to stick to the pasta a bit more. I chopped the onions small but I think i would make them even smaller next time and add more lentils. This was such a delicious dish I can\u2019t wait to play more with it.",
				"We enjoyed this bolognese last night and I forgot to take a picture, but it was delicious. I did saute some tomato paste after the vegetables prior to adding any liquid as that's how I used to make a meat based version. I use my food processor to chop all the vegetables, mushrooms after the others to speed things up a little. I must remember to add fennel as one reviewer suggested.  I've been a vegan 15 months and I've made several versions of this and this is my favorite. I don't even care for mushrooms, but they make this dish what it is and now I always keep dried ones on hand. Wish I could find chestnut mushrooms, but just used baby portabellas for the fresh ones. Thanks for a great recipe with easy to follow instructions for when you're in a hurry!",
				"This is wonderful and full of flavor! I used white wine instead of red since it's what I had on hand, fresh creminis , added some tomato paste and fennel, and swapped the herbs to be dry. Beautiful flavors!",
				"OMG! This is the best vegan Bolognese recipe I've ever tried! I've been Bethan for over a year now and tried many good recipes but the addition of dried mushroom and red wine just put this recipe at the top! I'm always sharing the recipe with family. Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania, Great recipe!I was wondering roughly how calorific would one dish of the bolognese and spaghetti be?Thanks!",
				"hi! I would love to make this recipe but my partner cannot have alcohol. is there something I could sub for this ? thanks!",
				"Hiya, just wondered if this recipe would freeze well?",
				"Just made this recipe and it is absolutely amazing! Left out the dried mushrooms, because I couldn\u2019t find them and instead added some more fresh ones and also added some tomato paste at the end, but nevertheless it turned out great! Thank you so much for your inspiration!",
				"This recipe looks amazing! I was just wondering if I left out the wine do you think it would make a bit difference to the dish? I'm not supposed to be drinking alcohol at the moment :(",
				"I just made this for dinner this evening, and it was SO good! I added in a pepper as I needed to use one up, which turned out fine. Often when I make these sort of dishes I don't let them cook slowly, so this was a really nice reminder that allowing things to simmer away for a while is so worth it. Thank you!",
				"Hi Ania, I made your bolognese recipe and it\u2019s the most delicious bolognese I\u2019ve ever made or eaten. It has a wonderful depth of flavour. The porcini mushrooms made all the difference. I\u2019ll definitely be making this again.All your recipes that I\u2019ve made have been very tasty. Even the meat eater in my house thinks so too.Thank you!Cindy",
				"made this yesterday, it was delicious, thank you.sweetened it at the end with a dessertspoon of molasses otherwise followed the recipe almost exactly - which is rare for me ...this is one i think i'll be coming back to often",
				"Just made this tonight and it was delicious. I found that the dried mushrooms felt a bit chewy...even after all the soaking and the cooking. I think next time I\u2019ll just leave them out and just add more mushrooms. I read that another follower added a bit of soy sauce at the end which I did as well and it was the perfect edition to just deepen the flavour. We\u2019ve made so many of your recipes and I have yet to try one that we haven\u2019t loved. Making your mushroom pulled tacos tomorrow as they are our absolute FAVORITE of all time. Xx",
				"I\u2019ve just found this recipe in time for tonight\u2019s tea and it smells amazing as it\u2019s cooking. I\u2019m so excited to taste it and have a look at your other recipes. I had to use my kitchens available ingredients as it\u2019s sunday evening so I\u2019ve left out the dried mushrooms as that\u2019s not something I keep in. Don\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter to much if the aromas anything to go by. Many thanks for your hard work and for sharing this lovely recipe.",
				"I stumbled upon your site as I searched for a vegetarian bolognese recipe...this one looked fab (I loved the idea of dried mushrooms to add depth of flavor!), so I tried it. Sooo good! It did take a while to prep everything, but I expected that. I served it over fettuccini for dinner, and even my meat-loving husband said it was fantastic. I just had some leftovers over rice, which worked quite nicely. The only tweak I made was to add a splash of sou sauce toward the end of cooking (I had also intended to add a couple of Tbs of tomato paste before adding the liquids, but I forgot). This recipe really is a keeper, and is delicious and satisfying in its own right (not just as a stand-in for what's usually a meat recipe). Well done - I look forward to trying more of you recipes :-)",
				"Your photography brightens the dullest of days!",
				"Hi! I just wrote a comment but not sure if it worked since my internet went a little funny, so forgive me if this is a repeat. I just wanted to say I love your beautiful food photography and am looking forward to trying some of your recipes, but I had a question about this one.... It might be a dumb question, but can this be made without mushrooms? Every other part of the ingredient list sounds amazing, so unfortunately being the mushroom hater that I am, I'm wondering if mushrooms are key or can I sub them out or omit them? Thanks! xo"

In terms of the veggies, you could simply cook them in the simmering curry, but that gives you less control over the \u2018doneness\u2019 of the individual elements and it affects the colour of the greens. Put the potato in first (takes about 12 minutes) and cover the pot with a lid. After 6 minutes, add in the beans and cauliflower.

				"Wonderful! I added seiten as well. The recipe is definitely for keeps . I also decided to steam the veges prior to adding them to the pot, each per their own time to get them al dente. Amazing, no mushy vegetables in the dish at all! Thumbs up from Israel! Thanks \u2665\ufe0f",
				"If I were to add tofu to this, at what step should I add it ?",
				"This meal was everything i needed. It was so yummy, warming and easy to make. I am looking forward to trying more recipes, thank you sharing you gift and skills with the world.",
				"New favourite! This is so good, and so versatile. We make a large pot of broth then steam whatever veggies we have on hand and throw in some brown rice or rice noodles... delicious every time.",
				"Dear Ania,You have become my number one vegan blog, and every week I cannot wait to see what you come up with next. I am still working my way through all your past recipes, so have this one ear-marked for tonight. I am a bit aubergine-mad at the moment, so what do you think - cut in chunks and pre-fry the aubergine in a bit of oil before hand or  simply add with the sweet potato?  By the way, I have made your sticky chinese aubergine last week (https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-chinese-aubergine/) and it was a winner!Thanks so much for sharing our recipes with us - you are a gem.",
				"Hi Ania Made this today it was super delicious! And so easy. Best red thai curry i have had and I made it! Will definitely be one of my fav meals to make now. thanks Kay -",
				"I will file this in my 'Favorite Recipes' folder!  It was easy, quick and the flavors were comforting.  I did make oneboo-boo though - I added the red curry paste after the coconut milk instead of cooking it with the aromatics.  Nexttime I'll do it right, who knows, it might blow my socks off.  Thanks, Aniap.s. didn't have fresh lemongrass so I added 4 drops of lemongrass essential oil.  In case you're not a huge fan of lemongrass,I suggest you add it one drop at a time.",
				"Hi Ania, 2 questions:1. Do you have a recipe for a red curry paste? There aren\u2019t many brands here, and I didn\u2019t love the ones I\u2019ve tried2. Can I use baby corn from a can or is it better to just not use it at all? I don\u2019t even know how fresh baby corn looks like ;) Thank you!",
				"Oh my gosh - this was super delicious.  I had beans and brocollini on hand but no cauli or baby corn but it was still bowl licking good.  I took your suggestion of steaming the greens separately and then adding to the sauce - beautiful and vibrant.  This recipe is even been than our local Thai restaurant!  Thanks for a great recipe.",
				"why are there red chillies in the photo and not in the recipe?",
				"This is a keeper! Will try it next week. :-)"

				"5. Place the mixture in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. If the mixture runs off the spoon after chilling, stir in an extra 1-2 spoons of rice flour to thicken.",
				"6. Heat up the oil in a small pan. Traditionally, these are deep-fried, but you could also shallow-fry them if you like, in which case only pour enough oil so that it reaches about 1.25 cm / 0.5\u2033.",
				"7. For the deep-fried version, scoop the batter using two tablespoons and gently drop each fritter into the hot oil. If shallow frying, form the mixture into flattened patties instead. Take care not to overcrowd the pan as it will cause the oil temperature to drop too much and the fritters will come out greasy.",
				"8. If deep-frying, allow the fritters to resurface (they will drop to the bottom initially) and then keep on turning them around until they are browned on all sides. If shallow frying, simply flip them to the other side once the first side is done (about 2 minutes).",
				"9. Place the ready fritters on a plate lined with kitchen towels to absorb the extra moisture.",
				"10. Serve warm with a side of Thai sweet chilli sauce."

				"Hello, this recipe looks wonderful, but I\u2019m not seeing what temperature my pan should be set to for frying. I\u2019m going to try the shallow fry method.",

				"Delicious!",
				"Can I use dried kaffir lime leaves? There aren\u2019t any Asian markets close to me and it seems like Amazon sells them fresh but it would take a couple weeks to get to me. I can buy dried ones to be delivered right away though.",
				"Love this recipe! By any chance do you know if they freeze well? Got some Thai red curry paste left over...",
				"Hi Ania, The recipe looks yum.Am I able to bake it instead of frying? If yes, can I use the recipe as is.Many thanks.",
				"Hi! If using corn from the cob do we need to cook it beforehand? Or do we just use the raw cornels cut from the cob?",
				"These are fantastic!! I will definitely be making them again!",
				"So delicious! I used aquafaba instead of flax egg and they turned out beautifully.Thank you :)",
				"I wonder if I did a wrong step. The mixture was super crumbly and did not form a patty / stay as individual fritters.Any suggestions?",
				"Looks so yummy. Great recipe.",
				"I\u2019ve made these a couple of times now and love them.Very easy to make and really tasty. Many thanks.",
				"Hi Ania, Is this brown rice flour?",
				"Hi, I\u2019d just like to correct you on the lime leaves. They\u2019re called kefir like the yogurt not kaffir, which mean non muslim or gentile. Hope that helps coz i personally live in Indonesia where we use lots of those leaves & fruit rinds for flavoring.",
				"I used white flour instead of rice flour and it turned out beautifully! So good and tasty!!",
				"Hello I tried your carrot cake this weekend and so far it is the best carrot cake I ever made. I did not do the frosting on top, just added a few chopped walnuts before baking and a drizzle of honey when still warm from the oven. thank you.",
				"Love these. But odd that the adverts in your page are all meat related!!!  KFC and dettol to kill bacteria from raw chicken!!!",
				"Love the combination of chia and corn ! Thank you !",

						"1. Cut twelve 8 cm / 3\u2033 by 8 cm / 3\u2033 squares from a piece of baking paper. Set aside.",
						"2. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt. Add about 120 ml / \u00bd cup of warm (that\u2019s important) water and 1 tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough that is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until it is elastic and smooth. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel. Allow it to rest for 10-15 minutes.",
						"3. After the dough has rested, knock the air out with your hands and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. I weighed the dough and then divided it evenly using scales, but you don\u2019t need to be as accurate.",
						"4. Knead each ball briefly before rolling it out into a 10 cm / 4\u2033 diameter circle. If you know how, roll the edges thinner and leave the centre thicker, but that\u2019s not necessary.",
						"5. Place each dough circle in the palm of your hand, put about 1 tbsp of filling in the middle of the circle and then pinch the edges above the filling so that the dumpling resembles a little sack of money. You can crimp the top nicely if you have the skills, but I don\u2019t yet so I simply folded the opposite edges of the circle together making sure the top is nicely sealed. You don\u2019t want the dumplings to burst open during steaming.",
						"6. While filling the dumplings, warm up water in a pot that your steamer will fit onto. You don\u2019t need the water to boil, you simply want the water to be warm enough to generate some steam so that the dumplings can prove in the steaming basket before getting steamed.",
						"7. As soon as you finish one dumpling, place it on a square of baking paper and put it in the steamer \u2013 but don\u2019t put the steamer over the water just yet. Leave ample space between dumplings as they will get much bigger after you are done.",
						"8. Once all 12 dumplings are ready in the steamer, place the steamer over warm (the heat should be off) water and allow the dumplings to prove for 20-30 minutes until they get about 1/3 bigger.",
						"9. After the proofing time, bring the water under the steamer to a gentle simmer and steam the dumplings for about 15-20 minutes.",
						"10. Take the steamer off the water, but do not peak inside yet. Allow the buns to rest for 5-10 minutes before taking them out of the steamer."

					"FILLING": [
						"1. Clean your mushrooms and chop them into an 0.5 cm / 0.2\u2033 dice. If using tofu instead of mushrooms, drain and pat it dry with paper towels. Dice it into a similar size dice.",
						"2. Mix all of the sauce ingredients: tamari / soy sauce, wine, hoisin sauce, sugar, five spice, pepper and vinegar (if using, it\u2019s not traditionally used, but I felt like it\u2019s needed to cut through the sweetness) in a bowl. Prepare the cornflour / cornstarch slurry by mixing cornflour with 2 tbsp of water in another small bowl.",
						"3. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a wok. Add mushroom or tofu dice to the hot oil and stir-fry until the extra moisture cooks out (mushrooms only) and the dice is lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.",
						"4. Clean or wipe the wok clean and heat up another tablespoon of oil, keeping the heat fairly low.",
						"5. Stir-fry the diced shallots until translucent, followed by the diced ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for about a minute, until the garlic gets fragrant.",
						"6. Return the mushrooms (or tofu) to the wok and season with 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil.",
						"7. Lower the heat, pour the prepped sauce over the filling and mix everything well. Taste and adjust the seasoning (add a pinch of salt, for example) if necessary.",
						"8. Finally, add the cornflour / cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce (give it a good stir before adding to the work). Allow it to bubble gently for a few seconds, switch the heat off and set aside to cool."

				"very good! I loved it so much! its just a bit tricky with the wrappers but it ended up getting easier and was so much fun to make!tysm for this recipe <3",
				"very good yes",
				"I don't know where I went wrong with this one. Everything seemed fine until it came to filling and wrapping up the dumplings - I couldn't put a lot of filling in per dumpling and none of them wanted to close up for me (even after googling a different method - the fold and pinch sealing one). :( Maybe because I used all purpose flour instead of bao? I also don't have a wok so I used a frying pan? Also maybe the dough was left a bit too long proofing because the filling section took a while to prepare and make. They still tasted lovely, just every one of them opened in the steamer. Sorry for the wall of text!",
				"So can u use a vegetable steamer? I have one with the basket but don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for this recipe.",
				"Just made these... leaving some notes for future cooks. Followed recipe to a tee, but couldn't fit all buns in my steamer so went with six in the steamer and six to proof on the kitchen bench. The ones that proofed over steam were undercooked, and totally deflated. I steamed-proof for 30 minutes, properly steamed for 20, and then left to rest for another 20 minutes. Dough was raw. The ones I left to proof on the bench for 60 minutes I then steamed for 25, and then left them to rest for a good 40 or so minutes were absolutely perfect. I am not sure what went wrong with the first lot but it is an amazing recipe, so much flavour etc., just next time i will do the standard bench proof.",

				"Anla, this looks like a great recipe. It says at the beginning that the buns can be made a day ahead.  Is that just the dough or the filled bun? Would the dough not continue rising in the fridge overnight?",

				"I made this cake yesterday and it was moist, delicious, and sophisticated! An excellent cake that will be revisited in the future.  Very rich, too!I hate it when people change a recipe and then review it, but sometimes changes are necessary. Thankfully, it is a very flexible recipe: I substituted almonds and almond flour (as hazelnuts can be hard to find where I live in the US). Used almond extract, instead of vanilla.   Most importantly, I ended up having to use Okara that we have from making soy milk.   (My local store no longer carries silken tofu). I really wasn't sure whether the Okara would work, but was fine.  The cake had some wobble when I removed it from the oven, but I followed the instructions to let it cool before cutting. It then set up properly.Lastly, whipping up the Aquafaba was a new and cool experience. Appreciate the advice to tip the bowl over as a way to check that it was beaten enough.",

				"This cake is incredible! I just made it and it turned out so well. Mine hasn't even cooled completely yet but I just had to taste it. It's chocolatey and moist but at the same time fluffy and light. I'm definitely making this for my birthday. If you love chocolate cake you need to try this one. I've tried quite a few chocolate cake recipes but this one stands out. I don't usually comment on recipes but I can so recommend making this cake.Thanks you Ania for sharing this recipe!",
				"Hi Ania,I had bookmarked this recipe months ago and I was saving it for a special occasion. Today was my dad's birthday and since he loves chocolate and hazelnuts I made it for him!I followed yout recipe exactly (the non gluten-free version) and it turned out incredible. But the most pleasant surprise, for me, was how much fun I had making it. The aquafaba meringue, the bain- marie, the folding...since becoming vegan this was one recipe that made me feel like a french cruelty-free pastry chef :)Thank you for your generous recipes, you do not omit any tip or step, it shows that you really want us to succeed.Have a nice Sunday,Baci Silvia",
				"Thanks so much for the recipe. I made it yesterday and it is very rich and quite yummy. Sort of tangy from all the dark chocolate, and a melt in the mouth, soft texture. It definitely needs the hazelnuts on top for the hazelnut taste as much as decoration.The aquafaba increases significantly in volume when whipped, so make sure to use a large bowl. I cooked mine a few minutes longer than stated as it was still wobbly in the middle after half an hour. I wasn't sure if the temperature was 180 degrees for  fan or conventional, so assumed conventional and dropped the temperature  to 170 for my fan oven. I used a 20cm square tin and it turned out fine. Expensive to make, but worth it for a treat. A small serve is enough so it goes a long way."

				"3. Add the chopped garlic. Keep on frying gently until the onion is translucent and the garlic softens completely and releases its beautiful aroma (approx. 5 minutes).",
				"4. Add a finely chopped Romano pepper and half a chopped fennel. Saute for a few minutes until softened.",
				"5. Stir all the spices into the vegetables. Fry them off gently for a minute or two (stirring the whole time) as they tend to burn easily.",
				"6. Add tomatoes and two cans worth of liquid (water or veggie stock and if you have an opened bottle of dry white wine handy, replace some of the water with wine).",
				"7. Add finely diced (or blended with some of the sauce) fire-roasted peppers and dried thyme.",
				"8. Add salt and simmer, covered, so that the tomatoes have a chance to break down.",
				"9. Once the tomatoes are sufficiently broken down (depends on how chunky you like your sauce), take the lid off and simmer for a further 20-30 minutes for the stew to thicken and for the excess moisture to evaporate. Remember to give the stew a good stir from time to time.",
				"10. While the sauce is simmering, grill the extra fennel (if using). To do that, cut the fennel into same size wedges. Heat up a griddle pan and brush it with a little oil. Place the fennel wedges on a hot pan, cut side down, and grill them until you get nice char marks on both sides. Set aside to add to the stew at the end.",
				"11. Heat up 1 tsp of olive oil in a very small pan. Once hot, add pepitas, toss them in the oil and allow them to roast (stirring the whole time). Take them off the heat once lightly browned, fragrant and crackling. Toss some salt through them \u2013 I like to use garlic salt.",
				"12. Once the sauce thickens, taste it and season with a generous amount of black pepper and more salt if needed. Romano / Ramiro peppers add sweetness to the sauce so you are unlikely to need sugar, but if you feel that the sauce is still too tangy, add a teaspoon of sugar or date syrup. If you find the sauce too sweet, on the other hand, add a squeeze of lemon juice.",
				"13. Finally, stir in the drained cannellini beans and let them warm through. Add the olives and grilled fennel just before serving.",
				"14. Decorate with fresh parsley (or thyme) and salt-roasted pepitas. Serve with rice, quinoa or couscous."

				"I cooked this on the weekend as I was craving something tomatoey and tasty (and it also had fennel so even better) and it didn't disappoint.  There were a few steps to follow but all worth it. Step 8 took a bit longer than anticipated and I only used 1 can of butter beans as that's what I had in the cupboard and to be honest, for us, it was enough beans, but other than that, this recipe was spot on. My partner has even discovered a love of toasted pepitas!  I served it with farfalle and it worked really well. Thanks for another tasty recipe.  I would definitely make this again.",

						"1. Place 120 ml / \u00bd cup of maple syrup and drained cashews in a blender. Process until silky smooth (if the mixture is bitsy, keep on processing, it will get smooth eventually even if you have an average blender like mine).",
						"2. Add all the remaining ingredients apart from saffron (if using) and cornflour / cornstarch and process until smooth. Sweeten with extra maple syrup to taste, if needed. If you plan on sweetening your pastry (see step 2 of the ASSEMBLY section), this may not be necessary.",
						"3. If using saffron to colour the mixture, place it in a tiny bit (a teaspoon) of plant milk and let it sit for a few minutes, then add the golden liquid to the mixture. Go easy on the amount as it\u2019s very potent. Turmeric can be added straight into the blender, but again, do not add too much (1/8 tsp is the maximum amount you will be able to get away with without overpowering the mixture).",
						"4. Transfer the mixture to a medium pot and warm it up gently on the stove, whisking with a wire whisk the entire time. Slowly trickle in the cornflour / cornstarch dissolved in water and carry on mixing to prevent lumps from forming.",
						"5. Allow the mixture to come to a gentle boil and simmer, stirring the entire time, just until it thickens.",
						"6. Once thickened, take the pot off the heat and allow it to cool down completely before filling the pastry."

				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F and grease a 12 hole muffin tin with a small amount of oil.",
						"2. Unroll the sheet of puff pastry, remove a piece of grease-proof paper and tightly roll it back up. At this point, you may want to sprinkle the unrolled sheet with a mixture of cinnamon and icing sugar to give the pastry itself some sweetness. I personally didn\u2019t do that as I prefer the contrast of unsweetened pastry with a sweet filling.",
						"3. Measure the length of the log and cut it into 12 equal segments \u2013 my pastry sheet was 23 cm (9\u2033) long so each segment was 1.9 cm (0.75\u2033) thick.",
						"4. Dust the working surface with a little bit of all purpose flour. Place the first segment on the working surface, cut side down and gently flatten the coil with a rolling pin into a large, thin circle. Roll the pastry fairly thin (2-3 mm / 0.08-0.1\u2033), it expands a lot during baking.",
						"5. Place the circle of pastry over the muffin hole and gently push it into the hole, making sure the pastry fits in snuggly all the way to the edges of the base. Cut the excess pastry off with a sharp knife.",
						"6. Fill the pastry with custard, leaving a gap of at least 1 cm / 0.4\u2033 at the end of the pastry \u2013 the custard will rise and puff up as it bakes.",
						"7. Continue the same way with the remaining 11 pastry segments.",
						"8. Place the tray into the hot oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Allow the tarts to cool down before removing them from the tin.",
						"9. If you have a chef\u2019s torch, sprinkle the tops with icing sugar or brush with maple syrup and blowtorch the tops. If you don\u2019t have a torch, place them under a hot grill / broiler for a few minutes, but watch them like a hawk as they will burn easily.",

				"Hello there, tried your recipe for the first time and they looked yummy! Only thing I would say is to blind bake pastry first as at least my vegan puff pastry (coconut) did not get golden in those 15 minutes required for baking the tarts. Also, the filling wasn't enough for 12 tarts, so next time I will double it. Had to use caster sugar on top of them in stead of icing sugar as icing sugar got absorbed by the moisture of tarts before I could use the blowtorch. Great recipe though, will definitely try again! Tasty! Thank you",

It was so nice too, to taste test the raw mixture and not get salmonella  :)  I think I'll even add some more lemon to the mix  and try it on a biscuit crumb for a baked cheesecake ?Great website, can't wait to try some more of your creations .",

And do you know if it would be a 1:1 ratio? If you don't know then I will definitely try your recipe using cornstarch first. Thank you x",
				"Hi. I have just made the custard! Yum. I ended up using extra tofu as I didn\u2019t want to waste the leftover tofu. It has made a beautiful custard. I blended in my Magimix blender but wasn\u2019t satisfied so finished it off in the NutriBullet which has made it silken smooth.I actually wanted to make a trifle with the custard! I\u2019ve made too much custard as I doubled the recipe. Oops. So do you think the custard would freeze okay? I\u2019m a learner so hopefully that isn\u2019t a stupid question!Wonderful recipe. Very sweet and creamy. Thank you.",

				"Thanks for answering! :)I was wondering if the silken tofu and cashews also can be replaced?",
				"Also, you generally cant buy maple syrup in my country, so I was considering to replace it with sugar syrup (light or dark?), but I have never tasted maple syrup and dont know how this will affect the taste? Or texture? Nuts are also insanely expensive here, so if anyone have tried replacing the cashews with something else, I happily hear about how that went! :) Thanks! :)",
				"Hello! :) I believe I read in a comment that if you are afraid it will taste too much of coconut, then you could just use the creme brulee recipe you have created, but I cant seem to find the recipe for it? :)Also I have never tasted a portugese creme pie, and I was wondering how the texture is? From the photo of it being cut, it looks very firm almost jelly-like? Do you have any tips on how to make it more creamy, and less firm? And I read a comment saying she had cut down on the maple syrup and it still tasted great, so I was thinking about doing the same since it might otherwise be too sweet for what I have in mind, but do you have any guess to how this might affect the texture?Thank you! :)",
				"Im afraid i Dont  really Understand how i am supposed to turn the dough into circles.. but these look soooo yummy!! If i Dont have a broiler would it be alright if i Just baked them?",
				"I love this recipe thank you - have been making the for my vegan food stall and they are always very popular - I only use half the amount of maple syrup in the recipe and its perfect for me level of sweetness and my customers seem to like it - they are excited at the prospect of a veganised Portuguese tart. I must buy saffron to see if I can get the colour more like yours in the photo - for now I use tumeric but I find the colour is not quite what I am looking for.",

				"Ania, thank you so much for doing this recipe and posting it!!!!I am Portuguese and I have been vegan for 4 years now. This is something that I miss so much eating. I thought many times to try to veganise it but like you I was scared of the custard. By far your recipe is the one that looks more like a Pastel de Nata on the internet.I will be definitely be trying this recipe. I will post it on Instagram when I do and I will mention you too. \ud83d\ude0aThank you so much again!!!  \ud83d\ude04",

First, you nearly perfectly retain the non- vegan textures. Second, you also perfect the familiar colours. These 2 things alone make vegan baking a real possibility instead of a slowly developing lofty goal. Thank you. Finally, I am confident in my ability to assess flavour based on the recipe alone. These look wonderful. I will be sure to post images as soon as I give this a try. Moussaka looks great too. Thank you.",

				"Ania, I so agree with you on both the gardening and the idea of switching off media for periods at a time. A love of gardening is usually acquired with age - perhaps because children are so often given the very WORST chores to do, which is a shame.  And EXTRA  sad if  addiction to our screens prevents us from ever learning to love working outdoors amongst the plants. This salad recipe looks fabulous!"

If the mixture is too dry (it should be soft and pliable but not sticky soft), add a teaspoon of the aquafaba you have saved \u2013 I find that depending on the flour used, sometimes it needs an extra teaspoon.",

I hate when I find a good international recipe and I need to convert all the ingredients; basically I spend more time converting things rather than making the recipe!! Hahaha.

				"This recipe came at the perfect time! My 85 year old neighbour gave us a few of his homegrown tomatoes yesterday so I immediately thought of this recipe.

Yours is without a doubt the best vegan food blog on the internet (maybe even overall, including non-vegan blogs), in that while there are other places around with good recipes I don't know of anywhere else that combines the genius you have for balancing flavours with culinary inventiveness and flair, while somehow managing to do so twice a week across a variety of styles of world cuisine. It's genuinely beyond my comprehension.The majority of our household's weekly meals now tend to be sourced from the recipes you've so generously shared. Thanks for making our vegan shift that much more enjoyable.",
				"Hi Ania; Very excited to try this vegan parmesan and was just ready to print out the recipe when I realized you hadn't included the black olives in the recipe. I happen to have some sliced Greek kalamata's on hand so want to incorporate those. The few times I've used olives in a pasta dish I've tossed them in after the pasta is added to the sauce, but I wonder if you have given them a quick saute with the chili flakes and garlic?"

					"\u2018CHEESE\u2019": [
						"1. If using the tofu option, crumble the cotton tofu into a large mixing bowl with a fork. Mix in the silken tofu. Season with a bit of salt and lemon juice \u2013 you can always add more later when you mix in the spinach.",
						"2. If using almond feta, it needs to be made a day ahead. I simplified the ingredients for this recipe as there are a lot of other flavours going on, but the method remains the same \u2013 please follow the method in this recipe. You will need to blend the feta mixture the day before and drain it overnight. You can bake it on the day you assemble the pie, but make sure you allow it to cool down before adding it to the filling mixture. Bake for about 75 minutes as it is a double portion."
					]
				},
				{
					"FILLING": [
						"1. Cook the spinach by either blanching it in batches for about 40 seconds and then plunging it into a bowl of ice-cold water (to stop it from cooking any further) or by saut\u00e9ing it in a frying pan in a good splash of water.",
						"2. Once the spinach is cooked, allow it to cool down completely and then wring it dry (that\u2019s very important as otherwise the pie will be soggy). I simply used my hands to squeeze all the water out of the spinach in small, palm-size batches. I am very diligent about it as spinach retains moisture like nothing else. Chop the spinach finely after it\u2019s been wrung dry.",
						"3. Heat up a tablespoon of olive oil in a small pan, gently stir-fry the spring onions and garlic until softened and fragrant. Cool them down before adding them to the filling.",
						"4. Mix the \u2018cheese\u2019 mixture, chopped dry spinach, lemon zest, mint, dill, parsley, nutmeg, black pepper, nutritional yeast, softened garlic and spring onions together in a large bowl. Mix them all really well with your hands. Taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning as required."
					]
				},
				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C fan / 320\u00b0 F fan (or 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F without a fan, although I recommend using a fan if your oven has one \u2013 it helps to crisp the pastry up) and grease a round tin or a baking tray with a bit of olive oil. If you don\u2019t have a tin the right size, do not worry, use a large baking tray \u2013 this pie is pretty self-contained.",
						"2. To assemble the pie, clear a large area of your work bench to make room for a long row of pastry sheets joined together. Keep the thawed pastry sheets protected by a damp kitchen towel so that they do not dry out and become brittle.",
						"3. Place a rectangle of pastry in front of you, making sure the longer side is parallel to you. Then place another rectangle to its right overlapping the ends by 5 cm / 2 \u201c. Follow up with the third sheet arranged in the same manner. You should end up with a very long rectangle of pastry.",
						"4. Using a pastry brush, quickly grease the entire area with a bit (not too much) olive oil and double all the pastry sheets overlapping them in the same manner.",
						"5. Follow up with another layer of pastry (if you want and have enough pastry sheets, it\u2019s not necessary).",
						"6. Brush the entire area with a little bit of oil again before arranging the filling on top.",
						"7. Put a long snake of filling along the longer edge of the pastry leaving a 5 cm / 2\u2033 margin at the bottom. Try to make the filling amount the same everywhere. I weighed my entire filling (710 g / 25 oz) and then divided it into 5 (this recipe spans a total of 5 sheets wide of phyllo pastry to fill a 26 cm / 10\u2033 diameter pie dish) 142 g / 5 oz portions.",
						"8. Starting from the bottom, gently roll the pastry into a long snake. Gently coil the snake, seam down, and place in the greased baking tin.",
						"9. Repeat steps 8-10 with the remaining pastry, but the second time round simply overlap two (not three) sheets of pastry side by side.",
						"10. Nest this new coil in the tin tucking its beginning onto the end of the first coil.",
						"11. Brush the pastry with some more olive oil and sprinkle with seeds for garnish.",
						"12. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, until golden brown. Allow the pie to \u2018set\u2019 after baking before cutting into it. Store the leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days."

				"I am so confused about the assembly. How many snakes do you make?",
				"Can I use store bought vegan feta? I have the Follow your Heart brand and thought that might work, but don\u2019t want to ruin it!",
				"I grew up in a traditional Bulgarian house where we grow up eating something similar to spanakopita but with feta cheese. When I made it my entire family and Bulgarian friends were very skeptical, however EVERYONE loved it! Highly recommend!",
				"I\u2019ve wanted to cook this for sometime and I finally gave it a try today.  We had this for dinner and it was so good!! I did the almond feta version and next time, I will do the tofu version\u2026 there will be a next time for sure!  Absolutely love your recipes.",
				"an awesome recipe which is a part of our regular meal planning . Love it We have a very good vegan \u201e sheep\u201c cheese here which i use for filling",
				"Noooooo, don't second guess yourself or this recipe! I've made it countless times by now and every time I do it brings me so much joy. I was just looking up the herbs I needed to pick up again (I don't make it during winter so I forgot) when I saw that reply and even though I never leave a comment, I felt like I had to. This recipe is so good I can only get 3 portions out of it and I eat the whole thing by myself. I have to admit I'm too lazy to mash the tofu with a fork so I tend to put all the ingredients in my magimix and get the filling that way, and it is delicious.Thank you for bringing spanakopita into my life, I'm pretty sure it will always be a favorite!",
				"This is the best vegan spanakopita recipe that I have found! I have made other recipes that I thought were pretty good but my kids were not as enthused to thwe point where I stopped bothering altogether because it is unmotivating to make a dinner that does not cause your family joy. Then recently I decided to try again because I was really in the mood for spanakopita and I found this recipe. The flavour was perfection and the lovely spiral structure made for very satisfying texture for every bite. EVERYONE HAD THIRDS!!!  I did not make a great effort to squeeze the water out of the spinach and it was still perfect. Excited to make it again tonight !",
				"Beautiful recipe. I haven't had spanakopita in years and this was so much better than I remember it being. The tofu filling is so good I made extra to have leftovers. Will definitely be making again.",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Can't wait to try it? I see that in the list of ingredients there is nutritional yeast but this is not mentioned in the instructions - at what point is this added to the recipe?Thanks, Sara",
				"The only tofu available to me are extra firm, firm, and silken. What do I use in place of cotton tofu?",
				"Do you need to press the hard tofu before using be t in this recipe?",
				"What do you use the yeast for in this recipe?",
				"The dough part of the recipe seems tricky or complicated. Do you have a YouTube of you making this recipe. I think it might be easier to follow when I see you making it.",
				"Wow this looks amazing!! Do you think I would need to change the baking time if I were to make the spanakopita flat instead of spiral? Thank you! :)",
				"If I wanted to make this ahead by a day so I could bring it to my family, would you suggest I cook it through and just reheat it in the oven?  Or should I chill/freeze it raw and then cook it when we're ready to eat?  Thanks!!",
				"What are the nutrition facts for this? Also how many servings does it yeild?",
				"This looks amazing! Would you usually enjoy this on it's own? Or do you recommend this more as a side dish/with a side dish?",
				"Does using the tofu option give it a soft texture like tofu? I've never really been a fan of the texture of tofu and was wondering if I'll notice that texture or if it'll have more of a feta texture? Would you recommend the almond option for someone who dislikes tofu or no?",
				"This is absolutely beautiful  and looks delicious. I am wondering, though, would it be worth trying to make this without the tofu or is it totally necessary for the filling to be spanakopita-y?  Asking as a vegan who can't eat soy but desperately misses spanakopita :)",
				"What the Greeks call Spanakopita we the Macedonians call Zelnik (Zel - neek) and we have many different variations of ours. Ania you have done it again and have veganised my most favourite lunch, dinner and snack recipe from my childhood. My Baba (grandmother) would assemble all of her sisters, daughters, nieces, and granddaughters once a month at 5 a.m. to start making the phyllo pastry from scratch. I had the most important job she would always tell me because I had the melted butter that had to be sprinkled around on ever single layer before she would fold it all back together and stretch it again and again. It was the most buttery, delicate pastry she ever made. There were many different kinds of Zelnik pies made and about 4 or 5 per household for coming together. This was a family get together and at the end of the day the kitchen was filled with Zelnik goodness and a few pans of Baklava for our dessert, besides we have the phyllo pastry already made so why not? I still do this but seeing as I'm one person I have resorted to the vegan phyllo pastry from the store. Thank you for doing this dish for the people of the Baltic region. <3"

This was recommended by my medical doctor who\u2019s also into natural rememdies and acupuncture. Take 15,000 units of VIT D so that\u2019s 15 x 1000 unit tabs or 3 x 5,000 unit tabs. Sounds excessive but it works!!!  As soon as you feel something not right in your body take this remedy. ONLY TAKE ONCE. It so works. Symptoms gone next morning . I\u2019ve taken it at night and during the day so works both times. I work in a hospital and DO NOT have the flu injections each year . I use this remedy and have great faith in it. May this be of benefit to you.",
				"Beautiful photography Ania, as ever!  I'm going to try these in my cast iron poffertjie/ Indian paniyaram pan. Have you seen one? The pan has multiple half circle indents that are lightly oiled then  filled and the contents form a natural ball as  you turn them about with a couple of skewers, or forks. Pretty healthy as little oil.Hope you are both well enough to enjoy your Welsh weekend."

				"I am new to cooking or new to trying new things. I am scared to try the pine nuts? What does that do for the dish?",
				"This was fabulously delicious !!! My beau needed something to do with his abundance of cherry tomatoes, and this is his second time  making the recipe. We tossed in a handful of fresh peas first time and second time a side bowl of calamata olives, just for a bit of pizzazz. I totally recommend this fresh dish and also recommend beaus' who like to cook :-).",
				"Made this tonight, with a few tweaks. The only one of note was that I used a crazy amount of pine nuts, like 1/3 of a cup. It was fantastic!! Thanks so much.",
				"Wow. This was so good. I enjoyed the texture. I only regret not doubling the revipe",
				"Ah! This is not a food-related question, but perhaps you'll indulge me: what hammock do you have? I've wanted one for a long time, too! This post makes me think I should take the jump..."

				"Summer in a mouthful! Absolutely loved the flavour combination + relative simplicity of this recipe. I replaced the sugar with 1/3 of a cup of eritherol and the result was a touch too sweet for me...even without the syrup and icing! Instead of the syrup, I simply sprinkled some lime juice on top. For gf flour, I used 50 % green buckwheat and 50% sorghum + quinoa mix which turned out wonderfully. I also was super generous with the zest and used 7 limes. I don\u2019t regret it :)",

Yay to experiment or nay stay away...?",
				"Namaste from India! I baked your cake a few times and love it! But I have a question as you mentioned in your recipe 4 lime zest. How much gram is that?! I'm sure we have much smaller limes as you mentioned 30ml is juice of 1/2 lime which here is much less. Could you help me out? I know I don't put enough lime in and that is also the feedback my neighbor gave me. Baking it now for the third time but still didn't got it right. Thanks!",

				"HI Ania; I can't wait to try this! Wanted to clarify 2 things in the Almond Bacon recipe: when you say \"tomato concentrate\" are you referring to tomato paste? Or if it's something other than that but not available here in the U.S., would tomato paste work in its place? 2) when you say \"almond flakes\" are you referring to sliced or slivered raw almonds? In the picture it does look like slivered almonds so I assume as such but just want to double-check. Thanks!",

						"1. Combine the flour, icing sugar, (plus cornstarch and xanthan gum if making GF pastry) in a large bowl. If using maple syrup instead of icing sugar, don\u2019t add it just yet. Add the softened coconut oil and rub it into the dry ingredients with your fingers until your flour looks like breadcrumbs and there are no lumps of coconut oil left.",
						"2. If you are using maple syrup, add it now and the chances are that you will not need to add any water to bring the dough together. If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup. Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it up in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
						"3. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",
						"4. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.",
						"5. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.",
						"6. Blind bake the pastry for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beads and bake for another 10 minutes."
					]
				},
				{
					"FILLING": [
						"1. While the pastry cases are baking, prepare the filling. Cream oil and sugar (or maple syrup) with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Add aquafaba, small amount at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"2. Finally, gently fold in the almond meal and almond essence with a spatula. You should end up with a thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).",
						"3. Fill the pastry case with almond frangipane and use a silicon spatula to spread the filling evenly.",
						"4. Push as many raspberries as you can into the filling. It will rise during baking a fair bit so don\u2019t worry if raspberries are sticking out. If using frozen raspberries, dip each raspberry into cornflour / cornstach first before pushing it into the filling as frozen fruit tends to ooze more water during baking.",
						"5. Bake the tart for about 45 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

				"Easy to follow recipe. I made the pastry for the first time and even though I used a whole-meal spelt flour instead of a white flour, it turned out pretty well. Brought the tart to a dinner with non-vegans and they all loved it. Thank you Ania!",
				"Love this recipe! Can I substitute aquafaba for non dairy milk /anything else? Not a big fan of the taste with  aquafaba!! Thank you so much!!!",
				"This recipe came out fantastic! I\u2019m a huge Bake off Geek and am always searching for vegan, GF , natural sugar alternatives to reproduce the classics! Flawless recipe!",
				"This is a perfect recipe. We had some delicious homemade raspberry compot, so we spread a  layer of that underneath the frangipane rather than using fresh or frozen raspberries. The pastry is a bit fiddly, but hey that's pastry for you, just remember to keep everything cool, all of the time and it'll be fine. The textures and the flavours and everything makes for a perfect bite every time. Thank you",
				"This recipe is simply perfect! Before I was vegan I used to work in a French bakery and we had a veeery similar tart there. This recipe made me so proud that I could make something like that myself (although I did cheat a little bit and used store bought pastry because it was quicker).",
				"I made this yesterday, following the recipe without changes, and it was quite nice. I had trouble with a couple of things, one was knowing how much water to add to the tart crust, it would help if there was something more descriptive about what it would look or act like when it's been sufficiently hydrated. My crust ended up a little tough so I suspect I added too much water? I'm not sure, but I didn't feel super confident about that step and next time I'll just use store bought crust.The filling tasted amazing both before and after baking. It still wasn't browning after 55 minutes in the oven and the crust was starting to get overdone so I wound up taking it out at that point in time. I'm not sure what happened there, but despite the lack of browning/crispiness on top we thought it tasted really good after cooling and slicing it, just had to eat around the crust a little bit. It was very tender and moist but held its shape enough to slice, which was nice. Anyway, thanks for the recipe!",
				"I forgot to select the 5 stars. Hope you can do it for me please.",
				"This is another winning recipe! Thank you so much Ania, your blog is the first place I look when needing a recipe. What I love is that you give the healthier options too. I used coconut sugar in this and it was great! I also used very ripe fresh pears instead of raspberries and it worked really well. This will become a staple along with so many of your other recipes.",
				"I made this tart over the weekend for a small gathering with friends, and it was an absolute hit. I'm in the US and used cake flour instead of all purpose for the crust and the filling. The only thing I changed was adding a thin layer of raspberry jam to the base before adding the filling (inspiration taken from your cranberry Bakewell and GBBO). Thanks so much for such a lovely, easy recipe!",
				"Perfect recipe! I've made this twice, it is absolutely delicious! I have not had results as  pretty as Ania, but likely because I used frozen raspberries instead of fresh. Though it still looked presentable, and tasted delicious!",
				"As a Canadian I'd never actually tried Bakewell tart but I'd always wanted to try making it. I know I love the combination of almond and raspberry so it seemed like a winner to me.The only problem I found with this recipe was that the batter was too dry - not even wet enough to be packed together. I added a few tablespoons of water to get a thick batter, and the tart still came out absolutely deliciously. I would definitely make this recipe again - a real winner!",
				"Yum! made this three times now and each time doesn't fail to make everyone's evening, perfect for having people over for dinner went down a treat! Thanks for a great recipe!",
				"Oh my goodness what an amazing recipe! I altered it by  using whole wheat spelt and oat flour for the base and I didn't have enough time to chill the dough once into the pastry case but the whole tart turned out so delicious! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.",
				"I'm so happy with how this turned out!! Was really yummy and had a perfect texture to it. And even better that it was refined sugar free too! Looking forward to using many more of your recipes to make delicious food :) xx",
				"I see flaked almonds on the top... so should we add them before or after baking?",
				"This is one of my favourite dessert recipes! It\u2019s so tasty! (I\u2019ve made it with frozen pastry just to speed up the process a bit) Thanks so much for another excellent recipe !",
				"The Frangipane was a winner, but the pastry was not for me   - I think the coconut oil was too prominent. But I ate all the topping haha! Thanks, will try again and play with the pastry receipt :-)",
				"I've made it with frozen cherries. Delicious indeed",
				"Hi Anja, I just want to let you know that I made this tart yesterday and it was.... divine!!! The crust was perfect, the sabl\u00e9 was so delicate, light and crisp! Amazing! And the almond cream with the raspberries was divine!!! The Combination of all ingredients and the sweetness was perfect! We all loved it!! Thank you so much for sharing your amazing recipes with us! You are so talented! Much love to you guys!",
				"Hi there. Thanks so much for the recipe. Can I ask where you can find white pastry four in the UK? Is this the same as plain flour?Also when you mention 1/4 cup flour for the filling, is this just plain flour?Anita",
				"Hi Ania,Should the aquafaba be whipped before added when making filling?",
				"Hello!  I can confirm that we've used this recipe a bunch of times and is always a winner.  Top tip: if you're a REALLY lazy cat,  just use store bought ready rolled pastry.  Thanks you guys.  I'm gonna be fat and it's all your fault.",
				"Hello Ania, this looks amazing (came across your recipe from a vegan facebook group). I'd love to make this for this Christmas, may I ask what type of oven you use for this recipe? Is it a fan-forced oven, or a standard oven? My oven has both settings so not sure which to choose. Thanks :)",
				"Delicious! Does it freeze?",
				"Hi Ania, I'm not a huge fan of buckwheat, can I just use gluten free all purpose flour for the pastry? ThanksJenni",
				"How do you store it if made a day ahead?",
				"Had  great succcess with this recipe. I followed the regular gluten recipe but used vegan butter instead of coconut oil. Found the tart needed an additional maybe 10-15 minutes  in the oven. Delicious and complimented by all the non vegans at the gathering . Thank you for your recipe!!!",
				"Hi Ania,I'm making this on the weekend, do you think it's better to make it and serve cooled on the day or would it be ok to make it the day before?Thanks!GG",
				"Wonderful recipe!  My new coworkers ate it all up in a single morning. Thank you x",
				"Hiya Ania! Is the white pastry flour the same as Whole Wheat Pastry flour?? I\u2019m in the USA & whole wheat pastry flour is what I most commonly see. :)"

						"1. Place the almonds in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for 30 minutes to soak. Rinse afterwards.",
						"2. Place the lemon juice, garlic, almond milk OR oil, a good pinch of salt, 1-2 tbsp of water (or more almond milk) and rinsed almonds in an upright blender.",
						"3. Blend until smooth, use a spatula to return the mixture that stays on the walls of your blender back to the centre. The mixture will eventually get really thick and the blender will struggle. I have a little trick to combat this, but please be very careful as it requires you to have the lid off while the blender is running. I slide my spatula flat against the wall of the blender and ever so slightly push the mixture into the centre, which sort of feeds it back into the blades again and prevents an air bubble from forming underneath the surface. I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.",
						"4. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.",
						"5. If you want your \u2018feta\u2019 to be shaped like a block, find a rectangular mould with drainage holes (I used this tofu press for this) and line it with a piece of dense cheesecloth (if the cheesecloth isn\u2019t dense enough to hold the mixture inside, double or triple layer it). Otherwise line a sieve with a piece of cheesecloth and place it over a bowl.",
						"6. Place the cheese mixture inside the cheesecloth. Even out with a spatula if you are making a block, if not bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a ball. Fold one side of the cheesecloth over evened out feta, then place the tofu press lid on top and weigh the mixture down (block) or squeeze very gently (bundle) to allow the excess water to drip away. Place in the fridge overnight to allow the mixture to thicken and for the excess moisture to drain away. At this point the cheese will be creamy but still fairly soft / wet \u2013 perfect for spreading on a bagel, but for this application we will need to dry it out in the oven.",
						"7. Gently place the drained cheese block / ball on a paper lined baking tray. Bake in a 140\u00ba C (285 \u00ba F) oven for about 45 minutes, until you feel quite a bit of resistance when you try to press the cheese gently with your finger. Allow it to cool down completely before cutting or it will fall apart. After baking, this cheese has a yellow crust (more pronounced if you use olive oil), which I simply trim off with a serrated knife before placing it on the salad.",
						"8. This cheese freezes well, so if you\u2019ve made too much (I tend to make a double batch), freeze some for putting on a pizza or in a salad later."

				"Well It's lucky I live in a house without a partner, because sticking fingers in bowls then licking them is very unattractive! This is such an awesome recipe (I did not make the salad as was just making the fetta recipe alone). I used 3 tbsp of lemon juice and 2 tbsp of macadamia milk with 1 tbsp of olive oil. No idea if that was a good combo for the wet ingredients but it seems to be, for sure. I also split the quantity to keep some in the soft state (you had me at 'spread on a bagel') and topped on toast and fresh tomato. I recommend this as it's really fresh and goes great with tomato. Some basil would have made it even better! The lemon juice really makes it I think. I also had no cheesecloth or even a tea towel so cut up an old gingham dress to use (don't worry...it was really not at all age appropriate). The other half is in the fridge now. Cheers Ania for this. I will make the bocconcini next.",
				"Does it need to be almond milk? I am shielding and can only get food delivered once per week but I have LOTS of oat milk!",
				"Hi! Can this be made with sunflower seeds? One of your recent recipes on Instagram mentions almond meal or sunflower seeds? Thank you!",
				"This sounds amazing and I will try it.  I have been trying to eat plant-based since January and being a cheeseaholic, it\u2019s a struggle.  I also love Greek food and especially feta. I prefer the creamy texture rather than firm/dry.  I will definitely try this although I recently found a good brand of plant-based Feta that has the taste and texture I love.  I will try this recipe though and I\u2019m glad someone else asked about using red miso paste because that was all I could find in my small city. Thanks for all your wonderful recipes.",
				"Do you think it would be okay to use red miso paste instead of the white one? Thank you :)",
				"Wow! This looks very healthy and mouthwatering. I'll try this very soon. Thanks for sharing Ania! Thumbs up! :)",

				"That feta looks wonderful! Thanks for sharing :)",
				"waouw,  so far I just made the feta, but I guess next time I will make more. I just did not know what  are silvered almonds, and you do not have the recipe in polish, so I just followed your instructions, but I took the peels off after soaking. Unfortunately my blender refused to cooperate, even after grinding the almonds in my  good old Moulinette (must be between 40 and 50 years old) but then Moulinette finished the job quite well.  I can't wait to eat. Thanks a lot, merci beaucoup, dzienkuje bardzo!"

				"I made these with buckwheat flour and almond butter and they turned out really good. I was using already peeled bananas from the freezer and so threw caution to the wind and went from 200g peeled bananas. I checked after 22 minutes and ended up leaving them another 10 for a total of 32 minutes bake time and that was perfect. I will be making these again though perhaps trying a wee bit less banana next time",
				"I followed the recipe to the exact but the middle of the muffins were doughy and uncooked....even cooking longer, they never cooked properly.",
				"Was really excited to make banana bread muffins so I tried this recipe but as others have said there is no where near enough flour in the recipe!! I cooked for almost 30 mins but I had a feeling that 60 grams flour with so many wet ingredients wouldn't work out, should of gone with my instincts.... I would say this needs double the amount flour.",
				"Oh my god, these turned out sooooo freaking delicious! I want to eat the whole tray. I made these in a mini muffin tray in my toaster oven, and followed the recipe exactly (though I omitted the slivered almond topping). My baby girl is going to love these muffins when she wakes up :-) Thank you for sharing a SUPER TASTY recipe for the best banana bread muffins EVERRR!",
				"I\u2019ve made these at least 4 times and they turn out perfect! It\u2019s my go to recipe for when i have over ripe bananas. They\u2019ve turned out great with both buckwheat and whole wheat flour.  I make them for my kids and add a little chocolate chips. They love them and they\u2019re always gone by the next day \ud83e\udd23",
				"What do you think that calories are per muffin??They were delicious! I loved them!",
				"These are amazing! I made them today, I increased the ingredients to get 9 muffins, as I had some friends visiting. Really simple, quick to make, I like the short ingredients list. My son, 3.5 year old had two already (2nd one he took/stole from the tray without asking!)  Will definitely add to my favourite list, thanks for the recipe.",
				"Will this work with plain white flour?",
				"Having recently started a plant based diet, this recipe is far yummier than my non-vegan banana bread which I no longer miss! I added dark chocolate chips in it and it\u2019s amaaaaazing. The kids fight over them every single time. My oven is quite hot so I turn the temp down slightly and cook them a few mins longer than suggested. I hardly write comments on recipes but this was too good and so easy to make :)",
				"Love these! Made it with whole rice flour and it turn out fantastic. Also added crumble on top, also made with wrf. Thanks for yet another great recipe!",
				"Hi Ania Thank you for such an easy recipe! I used sunflower butter and muffins came out fluffy and moist. My only concern is I could taste baking soda  or baking powder a little bit as the muffins had a slight metallic taste to them.  If I use less of baking soda and baking powder would  the muffins still rise? Otherwise it is the most moist vegan, gluten-free muffins I\u2019ve ever made so far! \ud83d\ude00",
				"Hello AniaI loved this recipe, thank you!I was just wondering, do you think they could be frozen?Moe",
				"While I did adapt this a little bit, these muffins were so delicious and moist! Perfect mini muffins for our toddler. I used 1/2 amount of maple syrup because my bananas were super ripe and previously frozen aka extra liquid-y. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt and used white whole wheat flour. Little additions that made them extra yummy. Thank you!",
				"These have become my go-to muffin recipe! I love how healthy they are and my 2 year old gobbles them up! I always make a double batch, but that doesnt mean they last as long as they probably should (:",
				"I made these but I have to \"tweak\" the recipe a bit, I didn't have any maple syrup so I did use the coconut sugar and found when I added the flour (Buckwheat) it was a little dry so I added some apple sauce and maple essence, as well as some cinnamon - delicious",
				"Hi, these turned out pretty well for a first try. I used  50g buckwheat flour and  10g flaxseed and coconut sugar. I have  a fan oven so baked at 16 0 degrees but had to bake for about 25 mins.  I think these will taste even better tomorrow when the flavours have had a chance to develop. They would be delicious warmed up for breakfast! \ud83d\ude0b",
				"Hi, would it be possible to swap the almond butter for a different fat such as coconut oil? Would it need a touch more flour?Thanks",
				"Hi Ania,I just found your blog by looking for a new banana bread recipe. These muffins turned out really well! Almost magical how easily they are whipped up. Thanks for sharing! I will definitely try out more of your recipes. Very inspiring!Lena",
				"My first attempt making these completely flopped. They did not cook on the inside and it was clear there wasn\u2019t enough flour. For my second attempt, I doubled the flour (I used Bobs all purpose GF flour) and baked them at 375 for 16 minutes. They turned out perfect!! This will definitely be my go-to muffin recipe!",
				"This is a fantastic recipe! I used all purpose flour, crunchy natural peanut butter and added some mini choc chips.I made 12 small cupcakes instead of muffins and the result was a light, delicious treat that will be perfect with a cup of tea for an afternoon treat. I will be making this recipe over and over again, thank you so much for sharing!",

				"Can I use almond flour in this recipe? xx",
				"DELICIOUS!!",
				"Hi Ania, made these yesterday and they were sooooo delicious!! Moist and fluffy, exactly the kind of muffin I was craving! :)Thanks for such a simple and tasty recipe! I used buckwheat flour but I don't always have it on hand, so I was wondering if oat flour would work instead. Any thoughts?xx",
				"I made these muffins exactly as they are written only adding a sprinkle of cinnamon. They are so delicious. Love how easy they were to make as well. I will be making these again without a doubt. So yum, thank you!",
				"Is your oven temperature for a fan or conventional oven? Thanks",
				"Hi, do u think I can use Almond Flour instead since I'm on a low carb diet? Thanks",
				"Had these in the oven in only 5 minutes this morning when I found out about some guests dropping by. Great emergency recipe! They were quick and delicious. I would bet easy to customise too. Keeping this recipe forever :D",
				"These turned out wonderfully! Lovely and soft, with a slight fudgy quality that is delicious. I swapped the maple syrup for golden syrup and it worked great.",
				"Thank you soooo much for this very easy recipe! I've been baking bread and muffins for years and this is so far the quickest and easiest recipe I've ever found! I baked it on bread tin and sliced it before serving to my kiddos (5 and 2yrs old) and they absolutely love this! I use whatever available in my cupboard that includes macademia butter or pumpkin butter, date syrup, cassava flour or buckwheat flour thrown some flaxseed, chia and hemp seeds as well and all comes out nice and fluffy.",
				"You are a genius! These are by far the best muffins I\u2019ve made, so light and fluffy.   Way better than those I used to make with dairy and white flour. The only additions I made were to add vegan chocolate chips and flaxseed meal. I used whole-wheat flour.",
				"Do you think soft brown sugar would work as a sweetener?",
				"Hi, These muffins turned out quite uncooked inside ( I used all-purpose wheat flour).  What's I have done wrong?  Thanks!",
				"Hey there, any chance you could leave out the sugar/maple syrup all together? I know they wouldn't be as sweet but do you think they would still bake OK or is it all a delicate chemistry balance?",
				"I made these today.  Super easy but seemed undercooked, so I cooked it a bit longer and it burnt a bit and crumble apart.  Seems to be missing something.   Still very tasty...",
				"Tried these this morning and they were so easy and delicious! I like them even better than non-vegan muffins. Thanks Ania!",
				"A teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie spice or some cinammon and cardoman would be delicious added to this, I am making these to take for the annual fundraiser for the Cancer Council 'Biggest Morning Tea' that we are holding next Tuesday at our local Community House, this recipe has arrived just in time!",
				"I'm not quite sure what I did wrong but I couldn't get my muffins to bake completely in the middle. I've gone back over the instructions & can't see anything obvious other than I used Nuttelex instead of peanut/almond butter. I used regular plain flour.  Any tips for a very novice baker?!  I increased the length of cooking time too but still no joy.",
				"Hi,  was thinking you might find the wedding dress in Crete? Perhaps Minoan style \ud83d\ude09",
				"These are delicious! Perfect for solving my sugar craving this afternoon...and as these things go, pretty healthy and guilt free! Thank you :)"

Halved the recipe (boyfriend likes his pancakes savoury and as much as I believe I could devour ten of those delicious things myself I thought it best not to accept that challenge) and actually had to add some liquid, despite the blueberries releasing some liquid as they thawed. Might have something to do with that oat milk is thicker than almond milk? I also omitted the almond butter since I only had peanut butter at home and didn\u2019t want it to take over the flavour too much. I\u2019m really impressed with how they turned out as I usually find thicker pancakes a bit soggy in the middle, but not this time!",
				"Hi!These pancakes look amazing! Do you think it would work with frozen blueberries though? The fresh ones you buy are to me not real blueberries since they are white-ish inside instead of blue all the way through like the ones you pick yourself! Such a luxury to have them in the freezer as well to last until it\u2019s picking season again :)",

If I were to add a scope or two of protein powder (it\u2019ll make these babies a great post workout snack while traveling too... Vega\u2019s Coconut Almond flavor will be super tasty I think), would I just need to add more banana for the moisture ratio? Maybe apple sauce? I\u2019ll taste the sweetness before I add maple syrup too since the protein powder is already sweetened. Thank you ahead of time for any tips!",

Once hot, arrange the meatballs on the pan, allow them to brown on all sides, nudging them gently to a new side every now and then. Drain on a paper towel after frying, handle with care as they are fragile when super hot.",
				"10. Serve warm with your favourite pasta. I served mine with spaghetti coated in my wild garlic pesto, some baby capers and fresh rocket."

I was wondering what could be used to substitute walnuts in this recipe, as I would love to make it, but am allergic to all nuts. Or could the walnuts be omitted altogether? Thanks!",

				"This was a great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars onky because I had to adapt the recipe: no afobe paste so I used chili powder and an extra bit of tomato paste. Then I used a tsp of date paste instead of maple syrup  and I am lazy, so threw on some  store bought brocolli slaw veggies, homegrown tomato, and homemade tofu mayo, plus put it on a red lentil tortilla. Seriously delicious! This will stay in my rotation!!",
				"Okay, YUM! LOVE having taco night, and this is such a simple (and SO delicious) recipe to really bring up the flavour factor and even the meat eaters at the table fell in love! (I'm always so happy to show off how delightful a veg meal can be)I'll be making this frequently! Thanks so much for this recipe! Have already passed it along to a few veg friends to try too!",
				"These Pulled Mushroom Tacos are seriously the best vegan meal I\u2019ve made. This recipe is now bookmarked and will be a staple in our home. It is full of flavor and easy to make. I\u2019m so grateful to have found this recipe and Lazy Cat Kitchen!!!",
				"Such a fantastic recipe! It's tasty and quite simple to make. Preparing the mushrooms a day ahead also makes it very convenient when you have friends over. And everyone who tried it just love it (even meat-eater guests).This is now my go to recipe for pulled mushrooms: I also use them in burgers for example.I definitely recommend.Tr",
				"These are SO GOOD  !I've made the mushroom version, but can't stomach too much mushroom due to an intolerance - though it doesn't stop me sometimes ! Just wanted to let you know I experimented with eggplant as substitute, and after a bit of tweaking it works! I salt, wash and blot thin slices (so it is a bit more time consuming) and then cut them into equally thin strips. Fried everything up the same, then baked for about 20min, turned the mixture and then another 20m to crisp it up,  it was perfect. These are literally a staple for me now, I make them at least once a fortnight, sometimes more. :PThank you for this recipe !!",
				"These were fab! thanks for sharing. I wondered were you bought your large wooden serving board from?",
				"this recipe is a total game changer for me! SO GOOD!",
				"I see a few people have used portobellos instead.... another pulled mushroom recipe I tried roasted the portobellos first, said it helps shred them. Would you recommend the same or will they shred fine raw and follow the recipe as written?? Thank you, I can't wait to try this next week!",
				"Hi Ania,Are there any alternatives to the adobo paste which I can use?  Looking forward to making them!Thank you.",
				"A while ago I had a bowl at a restaurant with amazing pulled mushroom in it - this tasted just the same! I didn't make the entire recipe, just the pulled mushroom part, but honestly, these pulled mushrooms were so delicious anything must taste awesome with them.",
				"Do I have to bake it at the end if I made it straight away?",
				"Omg I have been plantbased 3 years and this is by far the most delicious  taco recipe I have tried thus far vegan or otherwise . These MADE my 5 de Mayo festivial of 1 top notch haha and ate it alllll last night. Thank you so much for sharing. I only had 7oz of mushrooms so I added a can of jackfruit. worked amazingly well together in this recipe and I'm thinking of making it again today.",
				"Thanks so much! One more question sorry! I saw someone asking about using regular oyster mushrooms which is what I have as well. You recommend just marinating the mushrooms and putting them straight in the oven rather than sauteeing them first. What does that mean for the liquid? Since in your procedure you say to cook the mushrooms in the sauce until most of the liquid gets absorbed. Thanks!",
				"Hi! I'm really excited to try this. I followed the link to the quick pickled red onions and I only found the list of ingredients but I didn't find the process of making them. Would you please let me know what I need to do? Thank you!",
				"Made these tonight and they were incredible!! Tip: cut the mushrooms lengthways, lay flat side down then shred. So much easier than fumbling and bruising the mushroom. Such a satisfying feeling hahaha",
				"Quick question: I live in the United States and I'm not sure what the difference between the oven temperatures for \"fan function vs fan setting\".  I just have a regular oven and I'm stumped. Not sure which temp to go with... Any clarification would be greatly appreciated. :)",
				"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!This recipe is the proof that tacos can be as good as the classic ones with meat IF NOT BETTERJust got into the plant based lifestyle and will definitely make more of your recipes.Best regards",
				"I am not a vegan but am slowly transitioning to more vegan/vegetarian food and this is one of my absolute favourite recipes! I've made it loads of times and even my meat-obsessed dad LOVED it!",

				"I\u2019m EXCITED to try this recipe for a gathering where there will be a lot of vegans.  I have bought all the ingredients and I\u2019m ready to go except for the mushrooms.  I\u2019ve called all the local grocery stores and none of them have oyster mushrooms, king or smaller sizes\u2026  what do you think is the most ideal substitute mushroom?",
				"I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to have found this delicious recipe. It screams umami and I'm completely addicted! Thank you!",
				"I have been on the look out for a good pulled mushroom recipe for ages now. So pleased to stumble uopn yours. I haven\u2019t tried it yet, but do you think the pulled mushrooms would work on their own as a side dish?  Thank you.",
				"This was SO good that I was genuinely a bit upset when I finished it!",
				"This was amazing. It was to follow and cook. And the taste was great. I didn\u00b4t have the same oyster mushrooms as you, mine were much smaller but I guess the texture is much the same for both. I will do this again and again and again. Thank you.",
				"Ania, I tried this recipe. Without getting into expletives this was fantastic. I upped the adobo paste, as I enjoy spicy foods, and it was all I could do not to finish off the entire dish. Wonderful flavor and texture, my mushrooms were on the long side (6\" maybe a tad longer) next time I might cut those a bit shorter in length to make it more manageable to eat. My wife and I loved it. You have a winner here, with lots of opportunity to make this a bardeque dish as well. Thanks for posting in Pinterest! AJ and Jann Gest Denver Colorado.",
				"I made these for dinner tonight, oh my goodness! They were about the best vegan dinner I have ever made, possibly that I have ever eaten! Thank you for sharing the recipe. I\u2019m so glad that I found it!",
				"I used baby bellas and portabello mushrooms since that was what I had on hand.  I have to say this was amazing.  Soooooo good.  They were devoured.",
				"These went up like a house on fire. Thanks for an amazing recipe!",
				"Omgoodness, these were just fabulous!  I couldn\u2019t find the mushrooms you used so I used portobellos.  We just finished up and now I\u2019m making another batch,Thanks  again.",
				"loved it!!!!",
				"These look amazing! But where I live I have never seen these huge oyster mushrooms... would this work with regular oyster mushrooms? or would they be too small to \"pull\"?",
				"Thank you the glossary  will be very helpful",
				"Ania, these look delicious! If my Asian store sold king oyster mushrooms... I've been on the lookout for these for a while now :/I have a question, sort of a recipe request. Would you consider developing a seitan recipe for Polish-style ham (szynka)? I have looked around and found a few recipes but they are not very convincing. I thought I'd leav this here! Hope you're having a great long weekend so far :)",
				"Wow, this is brilliant! I haven't seen oyster mushrooms here in Jura, but I'll keep my eyes peeled. Gorgeous photos, as always."

				"The best wild Garlic Pesto recipe! Tried and tested over a number of years. This year used cashews, lovely results.Can literally eat it by the mouthful!Thank you so much",
				"Great recipe thank you!Really delicious flavours and affordable with pumpkin seeds",
				"Delicious recipe, even though I made it with macadamia nuts and no nutritional yeast - our cupboards are quite bare at the moment! Also added about a teaspoon of Umeboshi paste as I\u2019ve seen other vegan pesto recipes use this - really gives it a salty, umami tang. Just bear in mind you likely won\u2019t need extra salt if you use this. Thanks, Ania!",
				"I'm in love with this! Weve had it with pasta, stirred through cooked peas and just had some on a poached egg with spinach on toast. Scrummy! I'm trying  to work a way of preserving  so we can  have this delight through the year. If I sterilised jars fill to the top and top with olive oil, seal and keep cool and dark what do you think the chances are if the oil has a long shelf life?.... x",
				"Hi  AniaI made a version of wild garlic chutney inspired by your wild garlic pesto recipe. It turned out really delicious. It\u2019s a great plant and I use it in everything at the moment. Thank you for the idea.",
				"I have frozen pesto successfully for many years. I can keep enough till the next season that way . It keeps the colour and flavour well  !",
				"Dear Ania - can the pesto be frozen?  Thank you.",
				"I made this exactly as the recipe suggests and it was wonderful. Full of delicious flavours, the garlic restrained by the nutty pumpkin seeds and the lemon kick is just right. The extra bite from the chillies is good. I served it with roasted pine nuts and grated Vegan hard scheese. Fantastic, I'm making more already. Definately worth a full 5 stars! Well done Ania.",
				"hi, I've been thinking of making my own pesto, but never dared as I find it too complicated. this convinced me to give it a go. as they say, food tastes better when it comes with a story. can you freeze this?",
				"Estoy  fascinada con tu p\u00e1gina!!!... reci\u00e9n la encuentro y me parece genial.  Gracias por  compartir tus recetas y sin duda estar\u00e9 comentando por ac\u00e1 . Saludos!",
				"Where do you find Garlic leaves?Do you think I can leave out the oil or what would you substitute for it?",
				"Spot on. Thank you so much for the recipe.",
				"That is an awesome story about finding the wild garlic leaves, kinda funny that lady would even care what you or anyone else would be so crazy for garlic, I have never had wild garlic leaves, but now I\u00b4m intrigued, plus I love pesto! great post",
				"Hello! What can be used instead of wild garlic leaves?",
				"Works well. I have a nut allergy & don\u2019t get on with pine nuts.  Very pleasantly surprised at the taste & texture   Created a simple but very tasty pasta dish"

				"3. Add the chopped garlic. Keep on frying gently until the onion is translucent and the garlic softens completely and releases its beautiful aroma (approx. 5 minutes).",
				"4. Stir all the ground spices into the onion-garlic mixture. Fry them off on a very low heat for a minute or two (stirring the whole time as if they burn they\u2019ll taste bitter).",

				"7. You can cook the butternut squash in the stew (it takes about 20 minutes), but I prefer to do so separately as it allows for greater control over its \u2018doneness\u2019. Bake in a 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 C oven for about 25-30 minutes or steam for 30 minutes.",

				"9. Chuck in the chopped kale for the final 10 minutes and cover the pot with a lid to allow the kale to cook in the sauce. You could also steam it separately for 10 minutes and add it to the tagine at the end.",
				"10. Finally, stir in the cooked chickpeas and let them warm through. Serve over cooked couscous (or rice), sprinkled with toasted almond flakes and pomegranate seeds."

I did not have butternut so I added sweet potato instead...Also sadly could not wait to order preserved lemon and so had to make due with salt and a little lemon juice.  Still very tasty.

						"1. Cut the pressed tofu into fish finger like blocks \u2013 about 1 cm / 0.5\u2033 wide and tall blocks.",
						"2. Place tofu fingers in a shallow bowl with soy sauce (or tamari). Make sure you flip the pieces to the other side now and then so that they absorb the soy sauce evenly on all sides. Marinate until all of the soy sauce has been absorbed (about 30 minutes).",
						"3. Cut the nori into strips where the size matches the sides of the tofu. I held each tofu in between two strips of nori when coating, but you could also wrap the entire block in nori if you want a more intense fishy taste.",
						"4. If going down the cornflour route, prepare a shallow bowl and a large plate. In the bowl, whisk cornflour with approximately 120 ml / \u00bd cup of water to achieve a sticky mixture. Pour the breadcrumbs and \u00bc tsp of salt on the plate and mix well. Hold each piece of tofu between two strips of nori and spoon the cornflour mixture over the tofu. I found that dipping does not work so well in this case as the nori tends to separate and get stuck in the cornflour mixture. Press into the breadcrumbs and repeat if you want an extra thick coating.",
						"5. If going down the aquafaba route, prepare a shallow bowl and two large plates. Place flour on the first plate, aquafaba in the bowl and the breadcrumbs mixed with \u00bc tsp of salt on the second plate. Place two nori strips on each side of the tofu finger \u2013 the nori strips should stick to its moist sides. Then coat the tofu in flour, then aquafaba and finally breadcrumbs. For a thicker coat, repeat the last two steps again.",

Once the oil heats up (it\u2019s important that it is hot enough \u2013 a breadcrumb thrown into it should sizzle immediately, but not burn), fry each piece of tofu for about 1-2 minutes on each side \u2013 until the coating becomes golden. Place the freshly fried pieces on a plate lined with a kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil."

				"Just tried this recipe and the whole kitchen smells amazing!I replaced buckwheat with oats flour and used coconut milk. It tastes amazing.Thankyou for a great recipe",
				"Sugar isn't listed in the ingredients",
				"What a great recipe! The addition of buckwheat flour caught my eye, because I hadn't tried it in baked goods before. Being of Indian heritage, I had only ever seen buckwheat flour used in savoury dishes like stuffed parathas. I was a bit hesitant, so I used 1 cup buckwheat and 0.5 cups plain flour. I did not have coconut or demerera in the pantry, so I used regular brown sugar. I also skipped the banana on top, but tipped in a handful of raspberries (in season in Australia atm) and a handful of toasted pecans. The bread has these lovely crispy edges and the texture is perfect too, but what I loved the most is the rich nuttiness of the buckwheat flour itself. Next bake, I will definitely go with 100% buckwheat. I did not feel the need for a glaze, as it was intended to be a breakfast bread rather than an indulgent cake. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",
				"Ah! I didn't know buckwheat was also used in Polish savoury dishes. I just found a recipe for a vegetarian version of Go\u0142\u0105bki with mushrooms and buckwheat groats.  I have tried and loved the pork version in my meat-eating days, so can't wait to try this!",

				"The bread is moist and delicious. I baked half the recipe in an 8\" x 4\" loaf pan but it's very flat.What ratios of ingredients would I need for the 8x4\" pan. I don't have another loaf tin and wouldn't want to purchase one.TIA",
				"Best GF, egg free banana bread I\u2019ve ever tasted. Thank you",
				"I am using this recipe for my clients now. Am a baker in a small town Arusha in Tanzania East Africa. I read and tried it and everyone loves it. Be blessed  And continue to be a blessing to us all",
				"I've made this a few times now- so soft and fluffy each time! Really love this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it!",
				"The texture was so soft and perfect. I saw a comment about someone whose batter was too wet after measuring out 360g banana. I looked it up on Cronometer and apparently 1.5 cup banana is 340g, but I can\u2019t see the extra 20g causing any issues (in fact, a lil\u2019 extra banana can only make things better in my book). The banana bread wasn\u2019t too sweet, so I could top it with some maple tahini without it becoming dessert-sweet (aka perfect for snacks!)",
				"This recipe sounds perfect for me then! I love moist banana bread. I've had the misfortune of trying a few recipes that were awkwardly dry and needed to be toasted (similar to cinnamon raisin bread).I'll pick up some bananas this weekend and let you know how it goes once they ripen!",
				"I can't tell from the pictures, is this banana bread more similar to bread or cake?",
				"Made it! Delicious! Super moist! A keeper !  I have an egg allergy so I'm glad for this recipe. No one asked, they just ate and ate. I added hazelnut and almond chocolate bars roughly chopped  out of habit.  Next time I will try adding other  tidbits like oreos or marshmallows or cream cheese filling.Thanks!",
				"My go to recipe!!! I've been using this recipe religiously for about a year now, I've tried other ones and I always come back to this. I've tried some variations, adding nuts, rolled oats, it all works really well! I'm not vegan myself but my sister is allergic to eggs and honestly even if i was baking for a non vegan or someone who can eat eggs, i'd just make this one because it tastes banging!",
				"Hi, thank you so much for your recipe. May I know if I can replace buckwheat flour with all purpose flour?",
				"Hi Ania! Have you tried making this oil free?",
				"Thanks so much! It probably won\u2019t last 4 days anyway! \ud83d\ude03",
				"Hello, this banana bread is sooo good! Really moist and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe! It\u2019s def my go to from now on! Can I just ask how I should store it and how long it lasts? Thanks so much!",
				"Hi Ania I love your blog so much. This is my first time commenting but I have been using your recipes for 3 years. Such precise instructions and beautiful photography, thank you for putting so much care into the site. All the recipes I have ever made turned out really well. Your laksa, imam biyaldi and lasagna have all been demolished by dinner guests, and I have returned to this banana bread many times over lock down. Cheers :)",
				"This banana bread turned out perfectly! It is soft, moist and delicious! Since 2020 has brought a lot of time at home, I have been baking lots and banana bread has been a regular occurrence. I have tried a number of recipes and this is the best one yet! Highly recommend this recipe and even better, it\u2019s healthy and packed with goodness! And no animals were harmed in the process ;)",
				"WOW!!!!! AMAZIBG RECEPIE TURNED OUT ABSLUTLEY PERFECT !  Amazing texture and taste. I recommend muahing up the banana really well and making sure you leave it in the oven a good 8 min after the scewer is out clean to dry it up a bit so ita not mushy.One of the best i tasted!",
				":)What to modify if I want to make cupcakes out of this recipe? Planning to experiment something.",
				"Thank you. In some recipes the pre heat temperature and baking temp is different, hence the confusion.But you should know the cake turned out great, will be making it second time tomorrow. Will be trying one version without sugar and one without sugar banana, lets see how it turns out.If only i could post the picture here!  Try this link: https://ibb.co/34r7zxN and ktell me what you think!Another shot: https://ibb.co/LzZpdgCMy mom loved it, thank you!",
				"Hi, what is the baking temperature for this?",
				"I must say this recipe is amazing and i will most certainly be makimg again, had two bunchs of bananas to use up and made 2 banana breads, flavours are lovely just the right amount of sweetness as my bananas were  covered in black spots so very nearlly over ripe, I wonder if you have a rough chart of nutritional information as i do like to track my intake? Thanks again!",
				"Thanks for sharing the recipe. It was delicious! I love how moist the bread is without using eggs. I reduced the sugar to 90g and found it perfect.",
				"Perfect banana bread",
				"Hey.. I loved your recipe...and my family Loved having it.. Just one doubt.. The cake went flat when cooked down.. But it did rise so well while it was baking.. I mean the cake rose nice dome like a loaf on all sides while baking n had lovely cracks too but it slowly became little flat when switched off the oven n kept to cool.. It didn't sink.. Just deflated a little on all sides tlll the top level of the mould.. Hope I made u understand my doubt well..",
				"Do I have to use the lemon or lime?",
				"When I first made this it came out well and was very delicious but afterwards my second and third ones were too sweet and the batter wasn't cooked well even though I baked almost an hour! So I checked your recipe again and read the comments, then I found it! I measured the banana without peels from my second time because I got an electric food scale LOL Now I cannot wait to make this again for the fourth time! Wish me luck ;) Oh one question! If I want to make a half batch of this recipe, should I still bake for 50-55min?Thank you Ania for all your amazing work! I really enjoy to try your recipes :) Soyoon from Korea",
				":( followed the recipe but my banana bread turned out kinda mushy, with most of the mashed banana at the bottom. Tastes great but, any idea what might have happened so that I can make attempt again and make a better one?  :\u2019(",

				"So  Ania, you set yourself the challenge to produce a dish \u201cpacked with texture and flavour\u201d. Boom! This is a dish that needs to be experienced rather than described, so I\u2019m just going to thank you for this amazing recipe. The dressing in particular is stunning and one I\u2019ll be using in different contexts - if that\u2019s okay! Gochujang can be a bit of a bully, but your use of it in the tofu and the dressing is inspired. Thanks again, best wishes, Paolo",
				"Made this tonight and it was delicious! Nice and easy to make too.",
				"I got a huge Daikon Raddish in my Oddbox, and wasn't sure what to do. I combined a recipe from Oddbox with this *amazing* recipe for two days of stunning bibimbap lunch bowls. I swapped a few elements to what I had at home, so easy to do that with this recipe. Used quinoa instead of rice, but look  forward to trying it with rice next time. Added a little gochugaru to my pickling radish to spice it up.Delicious! thank you.",
				"Hi. It says serves 2-3 which is a shame as I would love to cook this but need to stick to strict guidance on food amounts for an anorexic child",
				"A go-to in our house that we have made numerous times for numerous people who have all asked where the recipe is from! So tasty and tastes so fresh with all the vegetables. Thank you for such a fabulous recipe!",
				"I love this recipe so much. I've made it several times and it is perfect. I like to batch cook my meals at the start of the week, and this is a great recipe for that. I prep all the veggies, then just cook the rice each day. The pickles are delicious, and the sauce is a nice alternative to tahini based ones. Can't recommend this one enough \ud83d\ude0b",
				"you saved my evening, Anya. I didn't think I even had the energy to cook but I managed this and it was delicious and just what I needed. thank you!",
				"I made a version of this because I had the Gochikamg and tofu in the house but no mushrooms or spinach. I baked the tofu and it was fine. I have sweet potatoes in the house so I roasted some  small cubes after ridding in the dressing. I happened to have some quinoa already made so I used that instead of rice. It turned out very well and we enjoyed it, especially the dressing.",
				"The dressing was so good!! It definitely tastes like the bibimbap my mom and I had at a Korean restaurant weeks ago \ud83d\ude0b the only thing that didn't workout for me was the tofu marinade; I find it a little bit on the salty side. I think instead of adding 4 tsp of soy sauce, I'll try adding just 2 or maybe even 1 tsp and just add more hot pepper paste. Overall, I really like the dressing and I'll try making it again sometime soon :)",
				"This is an exceptional recipe, full of flavour, easy to make and very healthy. I thoroughly recommend it to everybody. I think this is the best Korean-inspired food that I've ever made.",
				"Great recipe! Made a lot of people happy with this vegan dish the other night. Looking forward to try out some other recipes of yours.",
				"AMAZING, DELICIOUS, PERFECT. MAKE IT!",
				"Delicious and really beautiful bowl!! Thanks for the great recipe!!",
				"Made this the other night with a meat substitute, instead of tofu. Really great recipe that's so easy to prepare & it tastes amazing! THANKS!",
				"Thanks for a veggie version of this dish.it looks very good. I\u2019ll try it with tempeh as I don\u2019t like tofu at all.",
				"This sounds delicious, but I'm confused about the rice...you don't mention when/where to add it. I'm guessing it should be hot and added to the bowls. I haven't had bibimbap in years and don't exactly remember the configuration. Thanks for clarification. :)",
				"I made this and it was awesome! It\u2019s completely different from the other recipes I use, so it is a welcome pleasure. Thank you! Your recipes have so much flavor.",
				"Love this recipe! The prep time is way off if you factor in pressing the tofu, making the pickled daikon, and marinating the tofu. Otherwise the flavors were fantastic! Spicy, crunchy, savory \u2764\ufe0f",
				"This was really delicious. I found it a bit salty so I don't think I would add any salt if making it again. I'm not vegan but would happily make this a regular weekly meal. I replaced the daikon with carrot, used smoked tofu cooked in the oven and for veg finely shredded stir fried sprouts.",
				"Wow! This recipe is one of the best I've made in a long time. My husband actually stopped dinner to have everyone give me a compliment on the meal!!!",
				"This is amazing!! Better than at the restaurant! Thanks for the recipe, gonna make it again this week",
				"I just read your \"about us\" page. I didn't realize you'd lived in Paros. On our honeymoon 34 years ago, my husband and I went to Italy and Greece. We'd just graduated from architecture school, and we visited many beautiful buildings and architectural sites, but we spent the last week of our trip on Paros. We stayed in a little pensione and rented a Vespa to get to the beach and back.. It was so wonderful we never wanted to leave. I hope your transition back to the UK has been a good one.",
				"I made this tonight, exactly as written (I baked the marinated tofu because I like it chewy), and it was SO good!!!  I briefly considered putting a fried egg over it (which I know would make it not-vegan), but in the end I decided not to, and I'm so glad I didn't--I didn't miss it at all! Thank you for a great recipe!",
				"I made this on Friday for my boyfriend who is gluten/grain/starch free, and was stoked with how delicious and hearty it is! So good I am doing it again just a couple of nights later for a dinner party (and turns out someone is gf so I am glad I chose something that works for her). Looking forward to trying more of your recipes!Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
				"Made this twice now - really delicious - loved by all the family.  Didn't have gochujang sauce so used  sriracha instead and made an amai sauce for the kids. So, so good could eat this every day.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.",
				"Um, this looks delicious. Can't wait to try! Also...LOVE your logo \ud83d\udc4c",
				"I made this for some non-vegan friends and it was a huge hit!  (But I can't find a way to post a pic.)  So tasty.  I added a little avocado because I've gotten it that way before and since the real deal often comes with an egg on top, I figured that'd be a nice substitute.  Thanks for sharing this deliciousness!",
				"I clicked the link to the Gochujang you use, read the ingredients list, and found that it contains wheat, so not GF. Important info for Celiacs like me. Is there an alternative you could recommend ? I assume this paste is essential for an authentic taste in this recipe.",
				"I saved this on Facebook when you first posted it, and have been meaning to make it for some time - it looks incredible. However, this kind of dish is completely new to me. Of the 60-120 ml of water for the rice vinegar mix, how much would you recommend that a beginner start with (who is just starting to explore this kind of cuisine) to discover the flavours etc.?Also, I'm not into a lot of spicy/hot foots, I prefer things mild. Would 1/4 tsp of the Gochujang be enough to add flavour without too much heat?TIA :-)",
				"I'm so in love with your recipe, especially the gochujang sauce. Try to find out the sauce to eat along but couldn't. Thank you sooooo much! You make my day!",
				"So great! We have a very good asian restaurant in L\u00fcbeck that sells amazing Bibimbap and I wanted to make it at home! I really have to try this!",
				"wow - this looks so good! it's definitely going on my menu for next week.",
				"Tried it today and it was very tasty (and indeed, foolproof)! I didn't have the chance to try the pickled daikon - they didn't have any daikons or radishes at the store - but I'll definitely add it next time.",
				"This bibimbap looks so tasty, it's hard to find restaurants with great food, but at least you got inspired to create this amazing recipe",
				"Oh, this so funny! We are just in Korea for vacation and it is really difficult tovget a vegan dish. Nearly everything is either with meat or fish. So I will try your recipe as soon as I am back at home. Thanks for this nice inspiration!",
				"Ania, are you making ALL your recipes for me? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0aI'm in love with EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM! And I have a thing for Asian / Korean inspired food lately and I just made some quick pickled veggies the other day, inspired by you. Perfect timing, can't wait to dive into my pickled daikon jar and try this one too!!!Thank you for the endless inspiration \ud83d\udc9b",

				"I did that, rinsed it very well before cooking. Will make them soon again :) Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hi. I've made this recipe with quinoa. They are sssoooo good!Only that it was quite difficult to use the composition. I have added 1 spoon of flour to make it a little less complicated to use. It was really sticky, it got on my hands and on the spoon, it hardly remained in the tray. I hope I'll do better next time :)My question actually is Do you know if quinoa served like this is ok for kids? We have only boiled it so far. Never raw and fried. Thank you",

Sorry, but I have just one more question - I feel like 'Columbo' in the detective serie :) : what do you think that roasting the hazelnuts before grinding them would do to the resulting cookies?",
				"I  don't think I burnt the cookies nor the quinoa (I don't like my cookies or bread dark) and my mother didn't find them bitter so it must definitely be my palate : )",
				"Hi,this sounds very interesting but a bit scary to me. I have never tried eating quinoa in this form. Are you sure it's not too gritty and teeth breaking?",
				"I made them with quinoa and they are indeed crunchy! I followed the recipe, but even with the quinoa being toasted, I find the cookies taste bitter and not sweet at all (maple syrup is there but doesn't help to sweeten it up?) - or am I mistaken? I think I will try them with the hazelnuts - you didn't roast these first (for added flavor)?",
				"If you can work out how to do GF,  vegan Yorkshire puddings I'm all ears!",
				"Made these cookies last night with ginger powder and kosher salt on top, everyone loved them both vegan and non-vegan in my household. I used hazelnut  version. I also liked that it was only a few ingredients.",
				"Made them with orange zest and a few drops of orange EO and love the result! So crunchy! Do you think I could swap the quinoa for millet or buckwheat groats in the future? I have tons in my pantry and this seems like a great recipe to \u201csmuggle\u201d them in ;)",
				"Would this recipe work with raw millet or raw buckwheat groats instead of the raw quinoa, and, would I have to grind the buckwheat first because it's larger than millet and quinoa? Also, is it safe to eat quinoa, millet and buckwheat like that, just toasted (without cooking or soaking)?",
				"Omg this is oil free and crunchy??? I have to make these tomorrow (with the quinoa)",
				"are you serious about wanting ideas for recipes?  if so i would love to have a recipe for a healthy savory quick bread that was vegan.   that perhaps has some wheat germ and herbs in it.   I had something like that in my pre-vegan days and would love to have  healthier version that i could put some nut butter on and throw in my pack for a day of hiking or along side a nice seasonal salad.Thanks for considering",

I only have cocoa powder though... would that be okay instead of cacao?I will make it and return to rate the recipe (5 stars, I'm sure)You asked for a recipe to veganise: beef rendangIt would be SO amazing if you could get a vegan rendang with the same sort of texture and aromas. Really miss this dishAlso... Pakistani Saag Gosht (Rapini, Spinach, Red Meat).

I thank you so much for posting how to make date syrup and I think I will give it a try with the Sukari Dates. Awesome!!",

				"Hi Ania,Thanks so much for this recipe.I made mine nearly 3 weeks ago, and have left it outside of the refrigerator as an experiment.  Still  beautiful ..colour, consistency,  taste etc.Thanks again...Ps.... I have tried about 8 or 10 of your recipes already..and living them allThanks sooo much.",
				"Hi! Just wanned to say big thanks for this recipe! It worked perfect,  though I messed it up a bit when squeezing the dates  as I decided to use the slow juicer \ud83d\ude48  unfortunately,  the dates stucked up in the upper part  and no juice would come out.  Yeah, I learnt something  :)) As for the pulp I will use  it  in home made \"nutella\"  recipe\ud83d\ude0aBTW I used the  mazafati dates, 600g of which, where I live,  cost about the same as the ready made  SILAN, but  I still prefer to have it home made :)",
				"Hi, thanks for this recipe!!  What impurities are we removing by doing the first 20min soak?  I googled 'date impurities' and 'why do you have to soak dates for impurities,' but couldn't find anything (and now am concerned).  Thanks for all your work.",
				"How much syrup did you get from 1 lb of dates?",
				"Thank you Ania for sharing, so kind of you.  I bought date syrup recently at Winners, and I'm loving it, so I'm definitely making it when I run out! I wanted to ask you, how much syrup is this recipe supposed to yield?",
				"Mix date syrup with tahini and eat it as a dip with pitta bread. One great winter snack.",
				"Great recipe Ania. Will try itThanks.",
				"Amazing!! Thank you so much for sharing such a healthy recipe! I can\u2019t wait to make this :)",
				"Goodness me, you put out a great sounding recipe for a delicious syrup and all people can do is challenge you?!  Date syrup is great, works in so many things and has an excellent flavour. I like date puree also but for certain things (pancakes) you can't beat the flavour of syrup.  Yes maple syrup is tasty and relative to other sugars, also a decent choice but it is prohibitively expensive in some places or for some people.I am excited to try this, I need to get a cloth to filter the dates through first though.  Thank you so much for sharing as it sounds perfect.",
				"Hi there, thank you for the recipe. Do you do something with the remains of the dates? Do you use them for any other recipe?",
				"Could I use instant pot (5 min) to reduce slow cooking of 2 hours Thanks for yr advise",
				"I am making it today will let you know how it turned out.",
				"Thanks for this recipe. The syrup was lovely and I used for your Baclava recipe- it was lovely to eat some thing sweet but not sickly. Now thinking what to do with the pulp as it seems a waste just to bin it. Thanks again.",
				"Hi,Thanks for the postI prepared my date syrup last week and realized that it's fermented this week although I didn't refrigerateWhat should be doneWas it that it wasn't thick enoughThanks",
				"Hi i wanted to ask if you remove the skin of the dates before putting them in boiling water or do you just pit them? Also can I use mazafati dates?",
				"This was lovely. I used a nut milk bag to strain. Plan to drizzle on a warm eggplant salad with walnuts. :-)",
				"Made a batch . . . it is wonderful!Inspired by Spiced Silan Boubon Cocktail recipe in Adeena Sussman's book \"sababa\".",
				"Thanks for this recipe! I wanted to bake something with my hard-as-rock dates lol, and knew I\u2019d need to boil them to soften them up first. So I looked up ways I could make use of the water in which I boiled the dates, and I came across your article. This is just great! Thanks.",
				"Great recipe ! What did you do with the dates?",
				"For the first step of soaking, do you mean to say that we should soak in boiled water? Or we should boil the dates for 20 minutes?",
				"Looking forward to making this soon! Thanks so much.",
				"I blitzed the cooked date mixture in my Vitamix for one minute before straining out the liquid through the cheesecloth. The pulp remaining in the cheesecloth makes a superb spread on toast with butter. Also on crackers etc.",
				"If you follow Dr Greger, or even just watched the video you refer to for healthy sweeteners, you would know that your date syrup is not comparable to the whole date  puree he describes. Date puree , or date sugar, that he recommends is the whole date. Your date syrup removes all the fiber that makes dates his recommended sweetener.You should not be alluding that  date syrup is complient with Dr Gregers  recommendations for whole food plant based diets",
				"thanks ...",
				"Hi Ania ,Thank you for your posts",
				"Hi Ania,Thanks for the instructions on making date syrup at home. I did it and the syrup turned our great and some of my friends have also learnt from you. Thanks a lot and keep up the good work.",
				"Hi Ania, what will happen if the dates were cooked more than 2 hours (step 3)?",
				"Hello, I'm really looking forward to try this recipe, but I have one question - you advise to keep it in a glass jar, but I once bought date syrup in a plastic one and I'd like to use it, does it make any differnece? Apart from ecological reason, of course.",
				"Well done!Nicely written procedure. It led to the expected end.The syrup came out really nice. I am leaving it unrefrigerated to know how long it keeps. This is because I haven't seen any information online that talked about preserving without refrigeration. Plus, irregular power supply patterns in the tropics and developing countries doesn't encourage refrigeration. In all, well done Ania!",
				"Glad you linked a video to your recipe but i was talking about the fact that maple syrup is not bad for the health.  A video showing me how to do the date syrup is not a source for that.I made a lot of research on sugar for my radio show and i can assure you that maple syrup is not bad and is the only one that doesn't make the sugar level go up in the body.  Didn't know about the date sirup before so i don't know about it for the sugar level but you shouldn't put down the maple syrup as it is also a good way of sweetening something",
				"I don't quite get the idea of boiling  the dates first to get rid of the impurities...what impurities?  Does that  water not take a lot of the sugar with  it?   As to the  nourishing value of sweeteners like maple, honey, agave etc I really don't worry about it much as sweeteners are never used for their nutritional value.  My go to though is molasses ans love the stuff.  Agave and honey to have the value of a lower glycemic index.Good site...keep up the good work!",
				"Nice web design ........ Thanks for sharing",
				"Hi I was curious to know about the nutritional fact. Through this process like heating and simmering do the nutritional fact reduce anyway. Thanks for the elaborate process written. Irin",
				"Thank you for your posts! How long will this last ? Is it shelf stable?",
				"I wonder where you got the idea that maple sirup is not good for the health... it's the only one that doesn't even change the sugar level in the body and contains lots of mineralsI love the idea of the date sugar because it might be cheaper to make it than to buy maple sugar, but you should research about the maple sirup more",
				"What can you do with the date pulp?",
				"Just to clarify, do you boil water and then remove from heat and soak the dates, or are we boiling the water while soaking?",
				"This looks great!Any idea how long this will keep if refrigerated?",
				"The only two types of sugar that fare substantially better than others are date sugar and blackstrap molasses. The fact that date sugar proved to be a darling of this comparison isn\u2019t too surprising given that date sugar is essentially dehydrated and ground up dates. It is pretty pricey and not easy to get hold of, so I\u2019m not rushing to switch to it just yet, especially that it doesn\u2019t dissolve or melt like regular sugar so it doesn\u2019t work so well in baking, for example.Date syrup, on the other hand, is suitable for baking and as it\u2019s also extracted from dates it shares some of date sugar\u2019s nutritional properties. I'm not following the above.  Is date syrup okay for baking or not?? In one paragraph it is and the other it isn't"

				"1. Cut the tofu into 4 large slices. Place them in a shallow dish with 4 tbsp of soy sauce (or tamari), flipping them to the other side from time to time. Set aside to allow the  tofu to infuse with the soy sauce.",
				"2. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a frying pan with a matching lid. Add diced onion and saut\u00e9 until almost translucent. Add garlic and a minute or two later add ginger. Fry for another minute or two stirring frequently.",
				"3. Add the sliced carrot, diced apple, curry powder and garam masala. Stir around and fry off for a minute or two.",
				"4. Dissolve 1 tbsp of miso paste in 1 cup of warm water and add it to the pan.",
				"5. Simmer, on low heat (with a lid on) for about 10-15 minutes until the carrots and apples become soft.",
				"6. Transfer to an upright blender or use a stick blender to make a smooth, thick sauce. Season with tamari or soy sauce, rice vinegar and mirin. Add more water if the sauce is too thick.",
				"7. Prepare 2 large plates and one shallow bowl. Place flour on the first plate. Pour the aquafaba into a bowl and put the breadcrumbs mixed with \u00bc tsp of salt onto the second plate. Alternatively, you could skip the flour and instead of using aquafaba prepare an egg substitute by whisking \u00bd cup corn flour / corn starch with \u00bd cup of water. If that\u2019s what you decide to use, be aware than corn flour tends to drop to the bottom of the dish so you\u2019ll need to give it a good stir before coating each piece of tofu.",
				"8. Fill a small frying pan or the bottom of a wok with frying oil and let it heat up.",
				"9. Coat each piece of tofu in flour, then in aquafaba and finally coat it in the breadcrumbs. Press the breadcrumbs into the tofu and shake each piece gently before putting it into the hot oil to allow excess breadcrumbs to come off. If using a cornflour solution, coat each piece in the cornflour mixture and then in the breadcrumbs.",
				"10. Once the oil heats up, it\u2019s important that it is hot enough (a breadcrumb thrown into it should sizzle immediately), fry each piece of tofu for about 2 minutes on each side \u2013 until the coating becomes golden brown. Place the freshly fried pieces on a plate lined with a kitchen towel to get rid of excess oil.",
				"11. Serve with rice, a simple green salad and a generous amount of curry sauce."

				"I hate to be this person because this kind of stuff annoys me but I am highly allergic to fenugreek. It is in almost every curry powder I can find. I have a curry paste that is without it. How much would I sub in for the powder? Thank you in dance. This looks delicious!",
				"Love, love, LOVE this recipe.  And so do all 3 of my kids!  This is something I would have looked forward to ordering on a rare night out for dinner, am very happy to have found this epic recipe so I can enjoy it more frequently at home...  it is making repeat appearances at the table already.  Your recipes are fabulous!",
				"This recipe is now one of my top 10 all time favourite. I loved how it was so easy and it actually tasted better than it looked (which is pretty difficult because its a really beautiful dish). Thank yoooou so much for this recipe. The crunchy tofu is something I have had a hard time with, but this one was a complete success (I did it with cornstarch, corn flour and panko). Thank you once again",
				"Favourite go to recipe for sure!Is there any estimation of the nutritional values of this meal? No sweat of not! Thought I'd ask :)",
				"hi, Ania , can the tofu be frozen after its coated and cooked please, I  am  on my own and couldn't eat the whole tofu block on my own in one sitting.",
				"A delicious recipe, such delicately balanced flavours. Many thanks! I\u2019m wondering if it could also work nicely with smoked tofu?",
				"Love the recipes - but haven't tried them yet. When I do, I will combine the Aubergine & Tofu. Is the sauce the same? Just a quick query - is the teaspoon a \"flat\" teaspoon or a \"heaped\" teaspoon? I always say which when I write a recipe down. Flat is best, because (as long as you're using a measuring spoon) it's more accurate.",
				"We just had this for our tea and my omni partner and I absolutely loved it! It was that good I forgot to take a picture because I was too excited to eat it, but thank you so much for this recipe - amazing!",
				"What a great dish - my whole family (including my meat loving husband) loved this curry. Thank you for this great recipe and your detailed, easy-to-follow instructions. Hannah",
				"Made this last night and the whole family absolutely loved it, teenagers, 7year old and adults. I\u2019ve been asked if we can have it every day.I made extra and hubby has taken it to work for his lunch.",
				"Hi thanks for the recipe I liked the vegan bolognese and going to try this next... Can I use the leftover cooked chickpeas from making the aquafaba to make hummus?",
				"Absolutely awesome! Made this twice now and it\u2019s fast becoming a weekly favourite in our house, love the flavours and textures!  Thank you \ud83d\ude4f",
				"yum! sorry you had a bad experience at the restaurant, but i'm glad it inspired you to create this delicious-looking dish!",
				"This recipe was amazing! Thank you so much! Is it possible to freeze the curry sauce? As I have heaps left over. Will definitely be making more if your dishes \ud83d\ude0d",
				"How do you get the tofu shape in your images? Do you slice through the tofu horizontally? That would seem to make verrrry thin tofu.It may be that tofu is packaged in the US differently, I don't know...Thanks!",
				"Just served  this up to my  Japonphile family....total success! Lovely recipe, really enjoyed eating and making it. Thank you!!",
				"Dear Ania, and a nice recipe from you which was a full success at home when I made it tonight! The sauce is simple but very good. Never thaought that an apple and carrots would give such nice flavours and texture. I made the tofu with corn flour, I have no possibility to use the chickpeas cause we go on vacation tomorrow. But will try this next time definitely! Great, delicious and good meal, thanks! My daughter liked it as well and she hates cooked carrots. ; )",
				"I made this  tonight and we loved it! The sauce is perfectly balanced and goes so nicely with the  crispy fried tofu . I'll definitely make it again.",
				"Do you think its possible to try baking the tofu instead of pan frying it? Love this recipe a lot though, curry is one of my favorite foods and being able to see a vegan recipe for a meatless version, (with tofu - which I LOVE), makes me very happy! :D",
				"Do you have the nutrition facts for this recipe? It looks sooo good but I am currently counting macros and would like to know how it would fit in.",
				"That's great to hear, what an excellent decision you both made to move on.. and so few of us have had the guts and imagination to live the dream of an 'idyllic island'. However much we might fantasise about it.",
				"You may have left the vivid Greek light Ania but your  photography has lost none of its eye popping colour and brilliance! Hope Duncan's and your health problems are fully resolved in the UK setting.",
				"So smart to use aquafaba to coat the tofu! This dish looks so delicious Ania!",
				"OMG! You read my mind. The other night my Omni Japanese husband made vegan curry and he added tonkatsu for himself. I was thinking  that there had to be a way to make it with tofu and here it is! Can\u2019t wait to try this, thank you!"

Allow them to cool down.",

Slowly drizzle in the walnut oil while the food processor is running. Season with mustard, maple syrup and salt to taste. Add about 2-3 tsbp of water (or oil if you\u2019re not worried about oil intake) to thin.",
						"3. If you would rather not have any oil, I recommend tripling the amount of walnuts (or using a shop bought roasted walnut butter) and turning them into a walnut butter in your food processor (it\u2019s super easy and you don\u2019t need a high-tech machine \u2013 see this base recipe) \u2013 that way the walnuts release their natural oils and get all creamy. Use a portion of the walnut butter for the dressing, season as per the instructions above and thin with a little water if needed."

				"I have made quite a few of your recipes which have received praise from vegan and non vegans alike. Please keep your blog going.  It\u2019s been a life line for me. My question is about this lemon drizzle cake. I have to make it gluten free but I have read in other recipes to add xantham gum if using gluten free flour to help stabilise the mixture. Should I add it to this recipe?  Thank you once again for your lovely blog",
				"Hi, I'm going to try this recipe as it looks so tasty. But can I use self raising flour as I don't have any baking soda? Helen x",
				"Thank you, this recipe looks delicious - can\u2019t wait to try it! Do you think it would still work if I substituted oranges for lemons in a one to one swap?",
				"Loved this recipe! I baked it with my partner, who has never baked  before, over Zoom and ours both came out beautifully! Great for first time vegan bakers and the coconut oil can be substituted with any flavourless vegetable oil with similar results i've found! The sponge is light and fluffy but moist where the drizzle soaks in. I used a chopstick for the holes and had to cover the dents with lemon zest for photos afterwards so I recommend following the advice of a toothpick or cocktail stick for small barely visible holes. I can't get enough of the rosemary either - such a beautifully paired flavour :))",

Any advise on whether to keep it in a cooler or not would also be appreciated !  We are going camping and it will be a surprise for my partners bday :)  thanks so much !",
				"I have made this recipe twice, once gluten-free and once with standard flour. Both times it was delicious. I think the texture was ever so slightly denser than I would want and I'm trying to figure out if it's because of the sugar I'm using. I only have powdered sugar and granulated sugar available here, it seems caster sugar is somewhat in the middle of those two. I have been using 50:50 of each by weight, but maybe one or the other would work better? Would really appreciate any thoughts you have.",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you for this fantastic recpie. I've made it numerous times and even put my own spin on it by doubling the cake recipe which makes two lemon rosemary sponge cakes and then I iced it with lemon buttercream. So good! I just noticed the cake crumbles quite a bit, as do a lot of vegan cakes. Do you have any ideas on how to make it hold together a little better?  Thanks!",
				"Hi ,Loved the recipe ..looks great will try it tomorrow . Can u pls tell me what can i use for the glaze as i dont have icing sugar ...can it be replaced with any other type of sugar.. may be crystal sugar powdered  ??? Pls advice i really want to bake one soon. Love Kanika",
				"This is so delicious!  I made it for my book club because one of us is vegan.  I make another dessert as well, but this was the definite favorite.  Several members asked for the recipe.  Since then I have made it many times and it is always a hit.  Thanks",
				"Absolutely delicious! This was a hit! I grounded the almonds myself  so they came out a bit chunky and therefore the cake was a little crumbly and stodgy in places. Before serving I sliced it then added it to a warm pan to gently caramelise. Absolutely yummy, thank you for sharing x",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you for posting this recipe.This was my first time baking a vegan cake. It tastes lovely and is very fluffy. However, although I left the cake in the oven (160 C fun-assisted) for 50 minutes and the toothpick came out clean, it felt very heavy and fragile after coming out of the tin. When I sliced it it was too moist inside - not sure if this was because of the syrup or because I didn't bake it long enough. I put it back in the oven just now - hopefully it will be okay.I will definitely try baking it again - maybe leave it in the oven for longer next time.Thank you,Ana",
				"Your recipe sounds delicious! Can\u2019t wait to try it. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have plant/almond on me and stepping out isn\u2019t an option at the moment. Can I use normal milk instead? And If so, would the quantity be the same?",
				"This was absolutely delicious! I am dairy and egg intolerant which often means I can\u2019t eat cake often so I have been dying to try this recipe. It was so moist, tangy and delicious. My boyfriend  absolutely loved it too. It was so moist that it was a bit more pudding like and I used a spoon. I didn\u2019t use the icing and next time I make it, I\u2019ll do less syrup as it was probably a bit too much sugar but seriously good!! Definitely recommend",
				"What substitute flour could you use and what quantities? Would.like to be as paleo as possible.Thanks",
				"Great recipe! I made this cake today and I love it. I made only small modifications, such as reducing the amount of sugar and using sunflower oil instead of coconut oil.  I only had whole almonds at hand and I finely ground them. I believe that made the cake a bit more crumbly and easy to fall apart. I doesn't seem as dense as the one on your pictures is. BUT, it is really light and soft, perfectly baked and that lemon kick that you get at the end from the lemon syrup is just fantastic!",
				"Hi. I wonder what you mean with \"not from the fridge\" does this mean the longlife carton type milk?",
				"Hi Ania125g sugar and 1/2 cup don\u2019t seem to be the same?  125g is working out at 1 cup for me.",
				"Hello Ania, you suggested in one of the comments above that a neutral oil could be used instead of the coconut oil - how much neutral oil would you use?(For the solid coconut oil the measurement is 100g)Thank you",
				"I just tried this cake and it's absolutely delicious! I added some almond extract, which really kicked up the almond flavor. I am thinking of trying to make a lower calorie version of this cake - do you think it would be possible to sub half of the coconut oil for applesauce (this is something I sometimes do with banana bread to cut calories/fat down), and perhaps omit some of the ground almonds in favor of almond extract?",
				"Thank you, Ania. To be honest, this would be my first time freezing a cake. So, I bake it normally, freeze it and to unfreeze re-bake another 10minutes with the original temperature? Would be a pity to waste this amazing cake due to a wrong unfreezing method ;)Best regardsCaroline"

					"ALMOND FETA (needs to be made a day in advance)": [
						"1. Place almonds in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for 30 minutes to soak. Rinse afterwards.",
						"2. Place the lemon juice, sliced garlic, olive oil, a good pinch of salt, 1-2 tbsp of water (or unsweetened almond milk if you have any to hand) and rinsed almonds in an upright blender.",
						"3. Blend until smooth, use a spatula to return the mixture that stays on the walls of your blender back to the centre. The mixture will eventually get really thick and the blender will struggle. I have a little trick to combat this, but please be very careful as it requires you to have the lid off while the blender is running. I slide my spatula flat against the wall of the blender and ever so slightly push the mixture into the centre, which sort of feeds it back into the blades again and prevents an air bubble from forming underneath the surface. I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.",
						"4. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.",
						"5. Line a sieve with a piece of cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Place the cheese mixture inside the cheesecloth. Bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a ball. Squeeze very gently to allow the excess water to drip away. Place the sieve in the fridge overnight to allow the mixture to thicken and for the excess moisture to drain away. At this point the cheese will be creamy but still fairly soft / wet \u2013 perfect for spreading on a bagel, but if you prefer slightly firmer cheese, I recommend drying it out in the oven (see next step).",
						"6. Place the drained cheese ball in a greased ramekin and bake in a 160\u00ba C (320 \u00ba F) oven for about 30 minutes. Allow it to cool down completely before cutting."

						"4. While the onion is roasting, toast walnuts in a dry pan until fragrant and lightly browned in places. Move them about the pan the entire time as they burn easily.",

I steamed them as they were a bit old and thought this would make them less dehydrated.  Rather than use onions I also had a couple of leeks that I used in place of them. I used my high speed blender to bring it all together. It makes a delicious smooth soup which I served with seeds and some broccoli sprouts for a fresh nutritious crunch. Yummy!",
				"Made the soup on the weekend. I love roast parsnip but the soup was a little unfamiliar , taste-wise, to me. Kind of tart and a little too veggie tasting. I added extra miso  paste and it came together really nicely. I would just adjust the miso at the end rather than add anything else. I recommend highly! (served toasted paleo bread with the soup)",

				"I decided to try the Sunflower seeds and wow they are amazing. Loved this recipe I also added red Peppers and some Spinach as my daughter is not keen on squash but she loved it definitely making this again.",
				"Made this  today on a wintry Sunday morning.  Best mac and cheese I've ever made or had.  Delicious, zesty sauce and  a smooth, creamy consistency.  I made a few minor modifications - used sweet potato instead of pumpkin.  Also - I roasted it in lime juice as I don't use oil.  We used oat milk in stead of almond milk.  Will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe.",
				"in my opinion, the better it tastes, the worse it photographs, ha! this looks great!",
				"This is the best vegan mac & cheese recipe I've made. Love the sage flavour with the sweet pumpkin. The sauce did seem quite thick for me, I might have left in the oven too long or not blended enough. Thanks!",
				"I love a good mac and cheese as much as the next guy, but never tried one like this before. Added to the list!",

						"1. Place flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and very gradually start adding in plant milk (60 ml / \u00bc cup at a time) whisking the whole time. Whisk well after each addition to ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. Initially the batter will look thick and gloopy, but it will start looking like a cr\u00eape batter with every milk addition.",
						"2. Whisk in oil (or smooth almond butter), maple syrup (if using) and adjust the amount of plant milk to ensure the batter is the right consistency \u2013 it should be runny, but should coat the back of the spoon. I found that buckwheat flour requirs more milk (600 ml / 2\u00bd cups) than plain flour or GF plain flour mix (480 ml / 2 cups), so please proceed with caution \u2013 it\u2019s easier to thin the batter than to thicken it.",
						"3. Heat up a medium (I used 24 cm / 9.5 \u201d pan) non-stick pan on a medium heat. Brush the pan with a small amount of oil to make sure that the pancakes do not stick. Take the pan into your hand (off the stove) and pour a thin layer of batter (I found that 80 ml / 1/3 cup of batter is optimal) into the pan and swivel it well to form a thin, round cr\u00eape. Put the pan back on the stove and cook until the cr\u00eape no longer sticks to the pan and can be flipped to the other side. Once flipped, cook the cr\u00eape on the other side for another minute or so.",

					"VANILLA CREAM (optional)": [
						"1. Rinse the cashews and chop them roughly. If you own a very powerful blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec) this step may be completely redundant, but with my low-range (and fairy old) blender, this is the only way I can achieve a smooth consistency without adding too much liquid.",
						"2. Divide the chopped cashews into six portions roughly. Chuck the first portion of chopped cashews into a blender with vanilla seeds, coconut cream, maple syrup and lemon juice. Process until super smooth.",
						"3. Once smooth, add another portion of the chopped cashews. Process until smooth and repeat until you\u2019ve used up all of the cashews. Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn. To remedy this, start making circles on the surface of your mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula to prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface. Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from coconut cream, lemon juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a thick and smooth cream-cheese like mixture.",

						"1. Place smooth peanut butter, maple syrup and coconut cream in a medium bowl. Whisk with a wire whisk until you obtain a uniform mixture, but don\u2019t overwisk as the mixture may start releasing oil. Don\u2019t panic if the mixture appears to seize halfway through, it happened to me on two occasions but more vigorous mixing recovered it. If mixing doesn\u2019t help, add a tiny splash of hot water and whisk some more.",
						"2. Place aquafaba in a clean (that\u2019s very important as any grease residue will prevent the aquafaba from foaming) glass or metal bowl. Add vinegar (or lemon juice). Whip it with an electric hand mixer until you achieve stiff peaks \u2013 you should be able to invert the bowl and the whipped aquafaba should not budge an inch. If it does it means that it hasn\u2019t been whipped enough.",
						"3. Fold stiff aquafaba into the peanut mixture with a clean spatula until the two are well incorporated. Do it VERY GENTLY as you don\u2019t want to knock too much air out but thoroughly (peanut mixture is heavy so tends to drop to the bottom initially). The mixture will deflate a fair bit, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. Fill the tart with the peanut mousse mixture and place in the fridge for about 6-8 hours (or overnight) to allow the mousse to set.",
						"4. Once the mousse has had a chance to set, decorate the tart some dark chocolate and some fresh raspberries. Even though I drizzled my cake with melted chocolate for the photos, I recommend decorating it with chocolate shavings instead. Once drizzled chocolate sets, it becomes hard and it cuts into delicate mousse layer once you attempt to slice the tart, producing messy looking results."

The cake is moist and full of flavor. I baked it in 22 cm spring form and it was enough for 2 layers, thickness of 1,5 cm. Thank you for all your hard work. Your recipes are reliable, so you are in my top 3 bloggers.Sorry for my english!",

The coffee flavour is strong enough and the nuts in the batter make for  a wonderful crumb; I'll be trying this approach for all my cakes from now on! Thanks for sharing the recipe :))",

Would you suggest to swap the baking powder and soda maybe on my next trial?Also - I had applesauce I had to use up so I ended up swapping 40g of the oil into appleasauce and then using an additional 20g rapeseed oil! Definitely thought this was a risk but it worked!!I am also a huge fan of you banana buckwheat cake!!! You are an amazing recipe developer!!!",

				"Hi Ania, I found your recipe whilst searching for vegan and gluten free coffee and walnut cake and this looks amazing. I like that the ingredients list is quite short. I do have a few questions though.1) Can I substitute the ground walnut for ground almonds or just use more buckwheat (for gluten free version) or normal white flour (the other version)?2) If I wanted to make a bigger cake (I don't have a loaf tin or 16.5cm tin) do you think this recipe will work well if I doubled the ingredients or added an extra half of each ingredient?Can't wait to give this a try!",

I mixed extra coffee in the milk for the cake batter and it worked out great. I am curious to try this with hazelnuts some time. :) Thanks again for this amazing vegan recipe! <3",

Do you have any tips on how to salvage the frosting?  It\u2019s in the fridge at the moment so I was wondering if I could add anything to it to give it a smoother texture?I only found you on Instagram on Saturday, your recipes look amazing!",

Not sure if others will relate, but being fairly new to veganism, I\u2019ve had more misses than hits with baking in my journey so far - this one falls firmly into the \u2018hits\u2019 category!

Something that could blend well with the other ingredients. I'm planning to make two batches of this but the other one must not have any cashews in it since my husband doesn't like them. Your recommendations will be much appreciated.",
				"This cake looks superb Ania.. Im going to make the gluten free version as I actually have some buckwheat flour.. The pics looks like it has choc chips in it, or are they the walnut pieces? \ud83d\udc9e",
				"LOOKS GREAT!    I have some Q's - What is caster sugar? -I checked your glossary but not thereSo regular baking powder has gluten?  I had no idea!So I have Red Mill GF all purpose baking flour -- it's made with garbanzo, tapioca, fava bean,and white sorghum flours, and potato starch. This ought to work, right?   Thanks!",
				"This cake looks delicious but can you tell me what the dark bits are in the cake. Chocolate? Coffee beans? Can't find any mention in the recipe. Also, is there coffee in the atual cake or just in the frosting?Cheers , can't wait to make (and eat) this one!",
				"Don't know what I would do without you Ms. Ania. I am a new vegan and its been difficult learning to find and make dairy substitutes. Your blog sure has helped. I have yet to try anything however for fear of messing it up but I truly love seeing all of your beautiful effortless photos. I have a facebook cooking page called \"Ginnys Whole Foods Kitchen\" but I really need to work on the whole foods part. Thanks again for your dedication to a vegan lifestyle and inspiring others to do the same.",
				"When I saw this recipe in my email inbox, I clicked on it immediately, wanting to see your latest creation but certain it would be too complicated for me to make. But you've made it so simple! And that \"buttercream\"? Oh, my. I might have to double that portion of the recipe. :) I can't wait to try it this weekend. Thank you for another wonderful recipe.",
				"Hi AniaThis looks amazing - my mouth is already watering! I can\u2019t eat coconut products unfortunately so what could I use in place of the coconut oil in the coffee buttercream? Or can I just leave it out?  Would agar agar maybe work to thicken? Thanks so much, Caitlin x",
				"Hi Ania, I made this cake yesterday and it turned out beautifully! Thank you for the tip about the agar - it worked a treat. Thanks again for all your hard work on this blog - it really is one of the best out there. X"

				"It's crazy all this talk about phytic acid, yet out of the 1000 articles/blog posts mentioning phytates, you are the first one I have come across who mentions garlic/onion as a mineral enhancer! Thanks so much for putting the science out there and linking to Dr. Greger, I never knew about this information before and it's great to have in one's knowledge base on nutrition. :) Back to the recipe -- YUM!! This was so good and quick to make for a lazy weekday lunch. I halved the spices and ommited the chili so that I could share with my 2 year old, and it turned out so delicious and fulfilling. We ate it mixed with shredded spinach and a good dose of lime juice (vit C decreases oxalates in spinach ;)). This one will definitely be on frequent rotation in our kitchen! Thank you!",
				"How are the \"tempering ingredients\" used in the dhal?",
				"Ania, Thank you, I am looking forward to making it.. tom",
				"HI Ania,You mentioned, regarding presoaking \"combining phytic acid rich foods with onion and garlic neutralizes its negative side-effects\". I am intolerant of onion and therefore don't use it. I can tolerate some garlic though. Would you suggest a little garlic in this dish is enough to counteract the negative effects or would a pre-soak be advised? I'm new to this so wasn't aware of negative effects!Thank you for your help and your recipes.Tracey"

				"Delicious recipe.  I subbed  the organic soy mince for vegan chorizo (No Evil Plant-Based Chorizo - El Zapatista brand) and used dried kidney and black beans instead of canned (I wish I used canned because I was impatiently cooking the chili for 6+ hours); the flavor was sensational and well worth the wait, though.  I paired this with cornbread and ate for a few days.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!",

				"This chili looks scrumptious. I put cilantro/coriander in everything else I make, but I have not put it in chili, so I will definitely do that. Rather than TVP, I use bulghur, which absorbs all the other flavors beautifully and adds the bulk and chewiness that non-vegans want in chili. No one ever knows it's not ground beef. Thank you for another wonderful recipe. And take good care of Tina!"

I was really happy that all the quantities were spot on, as it's often not the case, which is very frustrating and always makes me suspicious that the cook hasn't actually tested the recipe. I loved the combination of the roasted garlic with the celeriac and the mushroom bourguignon was outstanding - I say this as lover of the traditional beef version - and it has a real depth of flavour. Thank you!",
				"Absolutely delicious!!! And super easy. Perfect dish to make when it\u2019s starting to get cold",
				"This is amazing! Cooked it for my husband and I, but it\u2019s a worthy dinner party meal! Thank you for showing me what to do with celeriac!",
				"Hi Ania! Always love your recipes, planning on making this soon- I was just wondering, what does it mean to season the mash with the garlic head? Do you press the garlic and add it or do something else? Super looking forward to trying this!/Sarah",
				"i absolutely loved this recipe!! so rich and delicious, it felt like a real treat! id also never used miso paste or porcini mushrooms before either so this really gave me some new ideas!! love it, thank you!",
				"This is one of my favorite recipes so far. Thanks for sharing Ania :)",
				"Absolutely delicious!! I have made quite a few recipes from your website recently and have never been disappointed. This is definitely one of my favourites though. I didn\u2019t add wine and I used dried shiitake mushrooms as well as brown mushrooms and had it with polenta. Thank you for the great recipes!",
				"Ania thank you so much! This was amazing and I never thought the little balsamic at the end added such an incredible flavour. Absolutely delicious.",
				"I tried this recipe  a few weeks ago and it was delicious! The perfect combo! And as a big mushroom lover this is a BIG winner :)This week I will make it again for a festive dinner with 8 pers. Do I just need to multiply all the ingredients by 2? Thanks for all your inspiring recipes!",
				"I love this fine French stew. Followed the recipe and first time using celeriac.  A fancy vegan dish.  I have a photo but not seeing where to post.",
				"I bought celeriac at my farmer's market this afternoon with the intention of making a soup. Then I found this recipe and had to run to the store to get mushrooms. It came out absolutely delicious. The celeriac mash was fabulous . This will be my new potato mash substitute as the taste is subtle and did not overpower the tasty mushrooms and vegetables.",

				"I made this exactly as written. Normally I'm tempted to add more veggies and garlic, but I'm glad I didn't. It's perfect as is. For variations, I'm thinking I'll make this with mushrooms, parsnips, carrots, potatoes? Do you think that would work?Didn't have time to make the mash but will make it tomorrow and let you know :)Thank you again. We loved it!",
				"Amazing!!Did a few changes though -I didn\u2019t make the mash - just roasted halved potatoes in oil & balsamic vinegar.I didn\u2019t ad any celery.I didn\u2019t have any dried mushrooms so I simply sub water.I added white wine instead.I added soy sauce for color.Had dried spices instead of fresh.Only used one type of mushrooms.It was SO good. But not as pretty as yours, though. That didn\u2019t really matter anyways. I wasn\u2019t up for any photoshoots today  (;Your blog is one of the best I\u2019ve found (It\u2019s you & minimalist baker). All the recipes of yours that I have made have turned out awesome!!

				"Delicious!  Made this for dinner last night and hubby and I both loved it.  Quick and easy comfort food. I was out of tomato paste so I substituted a tablespoon of Harissa paste.  Gave it a wonderful, gentle  kick of heat that added to the comfort on this cold, snowy night so I think I will do it again even if I have tomato paste. I am new to your blog but loving it. Have tried several recipes and all a success.  Thanks!",
				"Another cracking recipe. Very very tasty.",
				"Hi Ania,I\u2019m new to cooking vegan and I did substitute the celeriac mash with root vegetable and homemade horseradish paste.This is such a tasty recipe! Even my husband liked this vegan meal!Thanks for posting it!",
				"Made this last evening for my vegan housemate \u2014 very successful and much enjoyed. Added to my new vegan repertoire. Many thanks.",
				"This was delicious! This was my first time cooking with celery root & I absolutely loved the pur\u00e9e. I thought that I had more carrots , but only had one so I subbed a parsnip. I portioned this out into 3 divided containers  after my dinnner. (I think they call this meal prepping \ud83d\ude09) I froze two and am taking one with me on my layover. As a flight attendant, having nutritious, vegan meals can be challenging when you\u2019re away from home. Thank you!!",
				"I made this tonight and it was delicious!  This was  my first time cooking with celery root and it is so grod-I roasted it along with the garlic . The only changes  I made was to add a turnip as I only had one carrot. I didn\u2019t add the kale because I forgot.  This will definitely be added into my  recipe roster!",
				"Look yummy :')",
				"This was perfect! This recipe was simple and  delicious. I couldn\u2019t find dried mushrooms to make the mushroom stock. So, I found mushroom stock at the grocery store and reduced 3 cups down to 1.5 cups  and it worked great in the recipe. I also couldn\u2019t find vegan bouillon but instead used a veggie stock concentrate block to get the extra flavor and salt and had no problems. Thanks for sharing it!",
				"This was simply amazing. Thank you so much!",
				"Where does the parsnip come in that I see in the photo? Or is that just decoration?!",
				"OMG This has to be the most amazing recipe I  have ever seen! And I absolutely live Celeriac (better known as Celery Root here in the States).  I will be trying these recipes very soon!! Thank You!!!"

				"3. Now, add in the powdered turmeric and peppercorns. Stir turmeric into the aromatics, allowing the spice to toast gently before adding more moisture to the pan. Stir the whole time and make sure your flame is on low as ground spices burn easily.",
				"4. Add about 5 cups / 1.25 L of water and a veggie stock cube or vegetable stock. If you don\u2019t have any stock handy, but happen to have random unused vegetables in the fridge, put them in to create a stock on the go. I used 1 carrot, \u00bd small fennel bulb, a small wedge of cabbage, 2 celery sticks and a dried (shiitake) mushroom to impart more flavour to the soup. This is totally optional, but a good way to use up all these unwanted bits and pieces.",
				"5. Bring the soup to the boil and simmer gently for about 45 minutes.",
				"6. Season with salt (or soy sauce / tamari) and lime juice.",
				"7. If you want the soup to have a little more body, thicken it with coconut cream or coconut milk.",
				"8. Put the bowls into a warm oven (100 \u00b0C / 210 \u00b0F) to heat them up for serving.",
				"9. Serve hot soup over cooked noodles, bok choi and fried or baked tofu (see this recipe for details). Garnish with fresh coriander, sliced chilli and spring onions."

				"Hello! I\u2019ve made this once before and absolutely loved it! I was wondering if I can make the paste of step 1 in a batch and keep it either in the fridge or freezer. Have you tried? Just to have it ready and quicker to prep when I want to make it. We both have busy jobs so sometimes i look for these hacks. Let me know :)",
				"This is the best ever \ud83d\udc97",
				"Made this today substituting fresh fish for the tofu. I doubled the  paste ingredients as I love them all, but more chilli next time.  I used rice vermicelli noodles but didn't like them. I added 1/4 cabbage 2 carrots shredded and  a handful of dried mushrooms",
				"Such a stunning recipe- thank you for sharing! Made this today, I found i needed a little more lemongrass + onion and chilli. I also added some brown sugar and coconut milk- was scrumptious!!!!",
				"Hiya made this today,and it was lovely,do you know if I can freeze  the broth.",
				"This was delicious! I have a go to broth recipe but think this will be my new one! I also make my own turmeric powder and the flavor of it combing through was Devine! I\u2019m soy free too so didn\u2019t use tofu but added poached chicken breast (sorry not vegan) and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Yum thanks for sharing!",
				"Incredible incredible versatile broth, wow!!!! Simple is best, as they say...",
				"Hmm mine ended up very bitter unfortunately, maybe I cooked the turmeric for too long. So disappointed because it took me ages :-(",
				"Dear Ania,I am new to your site and have been a vegetarian most of my adult life, exploring world cuisine and LOTS of recipes.  May I say that your dishes are simply DIVINE!   I recently made the Ginger and Turmeric broth (and did add the coconut milk) as well as Tofu, red peppers, bok choy,  and organic baby corn.  My family was astounded at the flavor.  Even my 4 year old granddaughter LOVED it, saying, \" it is soooooo delicious.\"  My son settled on the words, \"absolutely delectable.\"     Next up, the \"pulled mushrooms!\"",
				"Yum! I love the combo of ginger and turmeric!",
				"Loved this recipe. It was a cold windy night and this was just perfect for warming us up. I added a spoon of red curry paste for a bit more body and a few cherry tomatoes. This will be a regular dish for sure. In fact I might make it again tonight!",
				"This recipe is delicious, and boy is it spicy.  I have to admit that I coughed after the first couple of bites, but I survived LOL  I loved the addition of coconut milk too.  I don't think that coconut milk in a recipe is ever a bad thing.   Thanks for the recipe.",
				"This looks and sounds divine! I can't wait to try it. Do you reckon it would freeze ok? Xx",
				"So glad I found your recipe! I made this last week and my boyfriend said it's the most delicious meal we've made at home - ever! I'm making it again tonight in a double batch for lunches all week :) x",
				"Hi! This looks amazing , I\u2019m making it for dinner in about an hour. I\u2019m just wondering what you did with the bok choy before adding it to your bowl? In the photo it looks a bit charred so I\u2019m assuming you threw it in a pan to soften it a little?  I\u2019ve never cooked with it before so I\u2019m not sure how to go about that part. Thank you :)",
				"Thank you, thank you, for this amazing recipe! I have made it twice now and I think about it all the time :) As others have commented, it is so healing and soothing. I could just drink a mug of the broth. After I make the broth, I blend it and strain it and it\u2019s so silky. Your recipes are fantastic as are your photos.  Thank you again!",
				"So excited to try this. My mouth is watering just looking at the picture. Looks amazing!!",
				"making this as I type but my base sauce has a bitter aftertaste? what am I doing wrong?",
				"Hi Ania,How do you think this recipe would go with fresh turmeric? Would you just increase the amounts?Thanks so much!",
				"Hi Ania, what a delicious healthy soup. I already made it and it is sooo tasty and warming from the iside out, perfect for cold winter days here in Colorado. Very Ayurvedic Thank you so much.",
				"This was amazing! Such a beautiful and tasty dish, so filling and lovely generous portion sizes! Yum! The best dish we've eaten/cooked in a LONG time \ud83d\ude0d"

				"1. Place cashews or sunflower seeds in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside for at least 20 minutes to soften.",
				"2. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F fan).",
				"3. Cut the top of the garlic head off with a knife (see photo in the post). Drizzle the top of the garlic cloves with a tiny bit of olive oil (it\u2019s optional but recommended) and wrap the garlic in a piece of kitchen foil so that the tops of the cloves are protected from getting burnt. Place in a preheated oven for about 40 minutes, until the cloves are soft.",
				"4. To make croutons, chop the bread roughly into small pieces. If the bread is too stale to cut with a knife, you could try my trick of placing it in a bag (mine usually comes in a paper bag already), keeping the bag closed with one hand, whacking the bread with a mortar (or something else heavy, a hammer is a good one) until the bread crumbles into small pieces inside the bag. It\u2019s also an awesome stress reliever \ud83d\ude09 .",
				"5. Heat up a tablespoon of olive oil in a small pan. Once the oil gets hot, throw the bread pieces into the hot oil. Allow the bread to get crispy and golden, but make sure you move the croutons around the pan a fair bit. Season with a touch of salt. Set aside.",
				"6. Once the garlic is roasted, decrease the oven temperature to 120\u00b0 C / 250\u00b0 F (100\u00b0 C / 210\u00b0 F fan) and line a small baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
				"7. Mix almond bacon marinade ingredients together in a small bowl. Toss the almond flakes in the marinade and spread them on the prepared baking tray.",
				"8. Place in the oven for about 20-30 minutes, giving the almonds a good stir halfway through the baking time. They may appear still a little soft when warm but will crisp up once out of the oven and cool.",
				"9. To make the sauce place peeled roasted garlic cloves, drained cashews (or sunflower seeds or silken tofu) into a blender with the remaining dressing ingredients and blend until super smooth.",
				"10. Assemble the salad by tossing torn lettuce leaves in the dressing (you\u2019ll have some left over). If using kale instead of lettuce, destem it and chop finely before dressing.",
				"11. Pile dressed salad leaves on a large platter. Sprinkle with almond bacon and / or croutons (if making) and decorate with some pomegranate seeds (if using)."

If using quinoa instead of couscous, rinse it really well. Place in a small pot and cover with one and a half cups of water. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Once the water boils, decrease the flame to low and allow the quinoa to cook gently until all of the water has been absorbed \u2013 to check, tilt the pot slightly (do not lift the lid) to see if water pools at the sides. Once all the water has been absorbed, let it sit (covered) for another 5-10 minutes for the quinoa to finish off cooking in its own steam.",

Once hot, chuck the broccoli pieces onto the pan. Stir-fry them quickly (for about 5 minutes) until lightly charred and cooked through but still crunchy.",

				"12. Glaze each sausage roll with soy or almond milk and sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds.",
				"13. Proceed in the same way with the two remaining sausages and leftover pastry.",
				"14. Arrange sausage rolls on a paper lined baking tray and bake for about 25 minutes, until the pastry has puffed up and become golden brown."

It would save a fair bit of time. I haven't dried them yet but I'm thinking that I will for some vegan visitors next week.",

I usually don't have to share my sprouts, but I have a feeling I'd better double this dish as even the nay-sayers will want to try it. Thank you! So glad you finally have your possessions and have that worry off your minds. Happy Christmas to you both!"

						"1. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F fan) and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"2. Cut off the bulbous part of your butternut squash (save it for another use), peel the solid part and cut it in half lengthwise. Brush the two halves with a bit of olive oil on both sides and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 25-35 minutes (depending on size), until almost cooked all the way through. Let the two halves cool down completely.",

						"5. Add in chopped spinach, cranberries, olives and 50 g / \u00bd cup of pecans and, if the pan is too dry, perhaps a splash of water (or veggie stock or vegan wine). Allow the spinach to wilt into the pan. Season with salt, pepper and chilli.",

					"BALSAMIC REDUCTION": [
						"1. Place balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring it to the boil gently and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes or so until the liquid reduces by about \u00bd and becomes thick. Beware that it will become even thicker once it cools so don\u2019t let it reduce too much. If you do, add a splash of water to bring it back."
					]
				},
				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Place the sheet of pastry in front of you so that the longer edge runs parallel to the work bench (I used a Jus Roll puff pastry sheet, which measures 23 cm / 9\u2033 by 35 cm / 13.5\u2033 cm). You will place your filling in the horizontal middle of the pastry. The width of the area designated for the filling is determined by the width of your butternut squash (mine was 8 cm / 3\u2033 wide).",
						"2. Sprinkle the remainder of the breadcrumbs over the area where the filling will be placed making sure you leave about 2 cm / 1 \u201d margin at the top an bottom. The breadcrumbs will prevent the bottom of the Wellington from getting soggy.",
						"3. Next pile the spinach filling over the breadcrumbs, into a well compressed, rectangular parcel (you may end up with some leftover mixture).",
						"4. Place the two halves of the butternut squash on top of the spinach parcel so that the cut ends touch each other in the centre. Brush the cut ends with a bit of balsamic glaze to \u2018glue\u2019 the two pieces together.",
						"5. Glaze the top and sides of the butternut squash halves with balsamic glaze and then sprinkle them with the rest of the chopped pecans \u2013 the nuts will create a barrier stopping the pastry from getting soggy.",
						"6. Once the filling is in place, make a series of 2.5 cm / 1\u2033 incisions in the pastry on both sides of the stack to be able to create a braid at the top. You can make the incisions perpendicular to the log (like I did in mine) or at a slight diagonal angle, it\u2019s up to you.",
						"7. Fold both end (top and bottom) flaps up, like you would wrap a present and then braid the strips over the top of the filling, alternating sides. If you end up with big gaps at either of the ends, patch them up with leftover pastry. This method works great here as it prevents slack in the pastry and allows for tight wrapping despite the slightly irregular shape of the filling. The tiny gaps in between the braids allow the steam to escape and prevent the Wellington from bursting while in the oven.",
						"8. Brush the pastry with soy milk.",
						"9. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is beautifully puffed and golden.",
						"10. Serve with your favourite side dishes (like hasselback potatoes, for example) drizzled with the balsamic reduction you made earlier."

I needed a vegan centerpiece recipe that didn't include anything seitan-textured, didn't include mushrooms, and could be made with reduced onion (due to other people's taste preferences) and this recipe hit all those points. The only thing I might change in the future is to slightly reduce the amount of sage. Thank you for this recipe! It ended up looking beautiful - almost identical to your pictures!",

It\u2019s a great holiday centerpiece and non vegans will also enjoy it. Everyone was very impressed by the appearance with the braided puff pastry, too.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I did not make the balsamic reduction because I already had a thick balsamic straight from the bottle. I also added 2 tablespoons of the balsamic directly to the spinach filling after it was done cooking along with 1 tablespoon of tamari for a bit more umami flavor.  When assembling the Wellington, my puff pastry (Pepperidge farm) was small so I just pieced together 1 full sheet with another half sheet and rolled the whole thing out a little bit to make it big enough. Then followed the weaving instructions.  Overall it was easy to make with a big impact. I have made several of Ania\u2019s recipes and they all have been excellent so I highly recommend!",

				"2. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 395\u00b0 F (or 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F fan forced). Line a large baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
				"3. Divide the cauliflower into same-size florets. Place them in a mixing bowl. Toss in about 2 tsp of olive oil and season with salt, \u00bc tsp cumin, \u00bc tsp coriander, 2 tsp nutritional yeast and a good pinch of chilli powder. Lay out on the half of the prepared baking tray, making sure individual pieces do not overlap.",
				"4. Place the carrot chunks in the same bowl. Toss in 1-2 tsp of olive oil and 1-2 tsp of maple syrup. Sprinkle with salt, \u00bc tsp cumin and \u00bc tsp coriander and a good pinch of chilli if you wish. Arrange on the other half of the baking tray, making sure individual pieces do not overlap.",
				"5. Bake the carrots for about 20 minutes, flipping to the other side half way through. Once they are done, remove them from the tray and cook the cauliflower pieces for a further 10-15 minutes, until charred in places.",
				"6. While the veggies are roasting in the oven, heat up a heavy-bottomed frying pan (or a wok). Once the pan comes to temperature, add 2-3 tsp of high smoke point oil. Once the oil heats up, chuck the chopped-up kale in. Stir-fry on a medium-high heat for about 3 minutes. Season with a good pinch of salt at the end, transfer to a plate and set aside.",
				"7. Wipe the pan clean and heat it up again. Add 2 tsp of high smoke oil and once the oil becomes hot, chuck the dry chickpeas in. Toss them in the hot oil and let them char, stirring from time to time. Mix \u00bd tsp cumin and smoked paprika, \u00bc tsp coriander and chilli, plus about \u00bc tsp salt in a small bowl. Once the chickpeas are charred in places, take the pan off the heat and tip all the spices into the pan. Toss the chickpeas in the spices quickly, letting them roast in the residual heat.",
				"8. Swipe a generous layer of coriander cream at the bottom of the plate, pile kale, chickpeas and roasted veggies on top. Serve with leftover coriander cream on the side.",
				"9. Rinse the soaked sunflower seeds well and place them in a blender together with 60 ml / \u00bc cup of water. Put the lid on but leave the little opening at the top open. Switch the blender on, trickling enough water (about 2 more tablespoons) for the sunflower seeds to turn into a smooth cream. Add lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and chilli and a touch of maple syrup.",
				"10. Pick most of the leaves of the coriander. It\u2019s okay to include some of the stems, but they do tend to taste a little bitter so I would recommend keeping most of them for a curry base instead. Wait with blending in the coriander until just before serving, if you can, as the cream will lose some of its vibrant green colour if it sits around for too long.",
				"11. Just before plating, blend the coriander in. Taste and adjust the seasoning if required."

I made two changes-TVP gives me mad gas, so I baked seasoned crumbled tofu and I added a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end of cooking to brighten it up.

				"Hi Ania,I've not tried this specific recipe yet  (I will within the week) but I wanted to take the time to thank you for your recipes and your website.  I adopted a fully vegan diet around four months ago, and initially I was struggling to find recipe ideas that were anything other than perfunctory . I came across your website, with recipes that both demonstrated and required a love and respect towards food and cooking  that was absent from other places. Since then I've cooked a variety of your recipe ideas to the ongoing appreciation of the family members I've been occasionally cooking for. Though they are not vegan themselves, the quality of the meals you've created has made it much more feasible for them to cut down on their intake of animal products.I wish you the best of luck for your move back to the U.K., and await whatever ideas you create for whatever winter meals and stews you think will serve us best in the coming months.Best regards,David",

				"Hi Ania, I\u2019m going to make this recipe for Christmas Day (very exciting stuff!) but I wanted to see if you think it will still be as yummy/turn our, if I either1)  make the entire receipt on Xmas eve and reheat in oven on Xmas day OR 2) made the sauce element including the onion/garlic stove step, then on Xmas day I can just cut the sweet potatoes and assemble to bake? Many thanks, T",
				"Would leaving out the lemon juice hurt the recipe? I can\u2019t have it due to acidity!",
				"Hi!Could I use regular brown miso instead of the white one? Thanks",
				"Can these be made without the miso and would you anything else instead. My son is allergic to soya...Was hoping to make them tomorrow (very late to rewrite I know) and was hoping he could have some too.Love your page and regulatory make loads from there.",
				"These look so yummy! I have a question though, mostly because I am lazy, do I need to  do the pre-cooking the potatoes step? I've just never made scalloped potatoes with pre cooked potatoes before and am wondering if I could pour the cream over the layered potatoes and then just cook it a little longer?  Or is the precooking essential to the flavor of the dish?  I'll make them either way because I love the idea of sweet potatoes in the dish :)",
				"750 kg patatoes.. seems like a lot!  ;-)",
				"What can I sub the miso paste with????  Tahini perhaps?Thanks,  BrendaThis looks delicious I can't wait to try it!",
				"I recently saw a Christmas recipe and it mentioned something called s eitan but what is it and how do you make it? I live in Azerbaijan and want to make a Christmas dinner for friends before we all head home. What is your take on the best meal savoury and sweet? I need ideas. Love the recipes. Thank you so much for the ideas. One more thing. No harisa paste in Baku what can I use instead?",
				"Yes! These look creamy and comforting. I  am always looking for ways to substitute sweets for regular potatoes. And put nutritional yeast on things.",
				"Glad you've found somewhere to stay... but be careful about letting Tina out into the woods--Bristol foxes are very possessive about their territories. The cats around here are very respectful about foxes, who are bold enough to saunter out in daylight, but a newcomer cat might not be so cautious.Oh, and I'll try those potatoes, just as soon as I get a better blender.",
				"I like this kind of meals a lot. Thank you."

						"1. Place the chickpeas in a colander for at least 15 minutes to drain them well. If you have time, leave your chickpeas on the sieve for a few hours so that they dry out a bit, you could also towel them with a paper towel if you wish. You may want to save the canning or cooking liquid (if you cooked them yourself) for another use like this cracking chocolate mousse, for example. If you cooked the chickpeas yourself, let them cool down completely before pan roasting them.",
						"2. Mix all the spices and salt together in a tiny bowl. If you haven\u2019t salted your chickpeas during cooking, use 1 tsp of salt. If you have or you are using tinned chickpeas, go easy on the salt (start off with \u00bd tsp and adjust to taste afterwards).",

Once the chickpeas are lightly roasted and charred in places, sprinkle them with the spice and salt mixture and mix everything well until all the chickpeas are evenly coated in spices.

Do not salt it until it\u2019s been cooked as salt negatively affects buckwheat\u2019s texture. Once the water comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and cook on a low heat until all the water has been absorbed (to check, tip the pot to see if the water is coming out from underneath the buckwheat, but DO NOT LIFT THE LID). Once the water has been fully absorbed, rest the pot for another 10 minutes (with the lid firmly on) so that the buckwheat finishes cooking in its own steam.",

Place the chocolate and coconut oil in a glass bowl over a water bath (bain-marie). Make sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Simmer on a very low heat until the chocolate has melted. Give the mixture a good stir and take the bowl off the heat to cool down.",

				"4. In a clean metal or glass bowl whip aquafaba and vinegar until you get stiff peaks. It is very important that the bowl has no grease residue as this will prevent the aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks. Once the aquafaba is at the stiff peaks stage (turn the bowl upside down, if aquafaba does not slide down at all, it means that it has reached stiff peaks) start adding sugar very gradually, half a tablespoon at the time, whipping well after each addition.",
				"5. Gradually (and gently so that you don\u2019t knock too much air out of the whipped aquafaba) fold flour and baking powder mixture into whipped aquafaba with a spatula or a spoon.",
				"6. Next, incorporate melted chocolate slowly until you achieve an even looking batter.",
				"7. Spoon the batter onto the prepared baking tray. I went for 9 large cookies, but you can make 12 smaller ones instead. Decorate each cookie with about half a teaspoon of smooth peanut butter swirled around with a toothpick and a light sprinkle of salt.",
				"8. Bake for about 10 (smaller ones) to 11 minutes (larger ones). Remove the tray from the oven and allow the cookies to cool down completely before eating (they may be a little fragile until they are cool). Keep in a dry cupboard in an air-tight container as these cookies absorb humidity easily."

				"Hiya!  Everything was going so well until I added the chocolate to the mix.  It turned out fine and then it decided to turn really spongey and sticky.  Kind of like a rough mousse but more sticky.  The chocolate was left to cooo for quite awhile and I did add it all at once.  Could that have been the issue?  Thanks!",
				"Hi, Have you tried leaving the batter in the fridge or not using it straight away? I need to bake some cookies for the weekend and for normal cookie dough i would leave in the fridge for a couple of days, but I'm not sure about this because it might impact the whipped element.Thanks Kat",
				"dear anjai really enjoyed whipping up the aquafaba (for the first time!) and was amazed by its stiffness.the cookies looked wonderful in unfinished form but then i put them in the oven. :-(they 'melted', went flat and spread to almost twice the size ,were full of air-holes.but worst of all the never went crunchy or 'stiff', they remained floppy and fall apart instantly.the kids say the taste is amazing and eat it with spoons off the baking tray.do you have any idea where i went wrong?thank you so much for your help!",
				"thank you ania, i will try again. the aquafaba was perfect, but maybe i was a bit sloppy with the ingredients. i'm more of a cook than a baker and used to improvise. so maybe there was too much aquafaba in it...anyway, i'll get there!",
				"Hi I am looking forward to making this recipe! Though I just ask, is it okay to use regular granulated sugar in place of the caster sugar?",
				"I grinded the  sugar just a bit like you suggested and they turned out great, thank you!",
				"I just made these and they went completely flat on me.. trying to figure out what I did wrong, because they taste delicious and I'd like to make again. The video shows apple cider vinegar but the recipe doesn't... so I didn't add any, but should I?",

						"2. Place rinsed rice in a medium pot with a glass lid and cover with 3 cups of water. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Once the water comes to the boil, decrease the heat down to low and let the rice cook until it has absorbed all of the water. Once all the water has been absorbed, switch the heat off but do not lift the lid and let the covered pot sit on a warm hob for another 5 minutes to finish off cooking in its own steam.",

Put the mat down and put a nori sheet on top of the mat, shiny side down. Grab some brown rice and spread it evenly on the nori sheet leaving a 1 cm margin at the very top, for sealing. As well as spreading the rice evenly, keep on pressing it into the mat with the back of a spoon.",
						"2. Place fresh spinach, carrot, cucumber, beetroot matchsticks and avocado pieces in a long line along the bottom edge of the nori sheet and leave a bit of space below so that you can fold the nori sheet over the filling.",
						"3. Using the mat, slowly start rolling the roll, squeezing it tightly with both hands as you roll. Go back every now and then to make sure everything is tightly bonded.",
						"4. Once you get to the end, dip your finger in water and brush the water on the margin to seal the roll. Finish rolling and set the roll aside. Repeat the last 4 steps with the remaining nori sheets.",
						"5. Once you\u2019ve rolled all the sushi rolls, cut them into 1 cm slices with a sharp knife. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi and a side of tamari (or soy sauce)."

And this recipe sounds absolutely amazing! I've never tried making sushi with brown rice before, but you've inspired me to give it a try. I don't ever really use brown rice, so forgive me if this seems like a silly question, but is there a specific type that's best to use when making sushi? I only ask because, as you know, you can't really make sushi without short-grain sushi rice, so I'm wondering if there's a short grain brown rice equivalent. Good luck with packing!",

The secret to moist cakes and muffins is to add a teaspoon of vegetable glycerin to the batter, a French pastry chef gave this tip to my Mother many years a go and it works. I made my muffins in the 'Texas' size as smaller one reminds me of cupcakes, they still turned out extremely well however they did require more baking time",

I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to do some substitutions.....and as it is with incredible recipes....it came out beautifully! I didn't have oat flour, so I used all purpose white flour. I used Ener-G egg replacer, used only pumpkin and sunflower seeds on the top.....and added 1/2 cup of each into the batter as well.....I also baked some of the batter in doughnut pan and baked for 20 minutes. These are a huge hit at home, as breakfast, a grab and go or just as a snack....so much so that I gave some to a friend who called this morning saying \"OMG! OMG!\" and asked for the recipe.

I do have a bit of trouble steaming my pancakes in the bamboo steamer (from Frozen), they often stick together and I end up wasting a few. Do you have any tips or tricks? Thanks!",
				"Made it.  Loved it. Thank you!!!",
				"Such a delicious recipe!  I\u2019ve had trouble finding recipes using jackfruit as the main ingredient but these were amazing. Thanks for the inspiration!",
				"This was DELICIOUS! I didn't have five spice,  so I added four of the five spices in it,  and had to follow a hoisin sauce recipe, as I only had plum sauce.The jackfruit had just the right texture after baking, and wad a huge hit.  Thank you!",
				"This was amazing! I have been craving this flavor combination for a while and this recipe didn\u2019t disappoint. Totally worth the make ahead preparation. Will be definitely making again",
				"Hi. Love the recipe it's a staple in our  house. Do you think we could substitute the rice vinegar as we are in coronavirus lockdown!? Vinegars we have are black Chinese, apple cider, white and red wine. Thanks for your site it's always inspiring .",
				"I made this and it was good,  but it was way too salty. I\u2019ll try again with low salt soy sauce next time.",
				"Ooo insomnia pays off! It\u2019s 4am here and I\u2019m about to go make this now so it can have the night in the fridge you recommend then I can serve it on Valentine\u2019s Day, aw. I had a right mission getting the pancakes - it\u2019s such a pain that most times they comes with the duck! I\u2019ll report back tomorrow night as to how it went. Thanks Anita, this will be my first jackfruit experience!",
				"I LOVE this! Lucky enough to have a shop a few doors down that sells tinned green jackfruit. I'd tried the \"pulled pork\" style and it got me thinking about using it in other shredded style dishes. Enter Google and here you are!  My newly converted bf loves it too. Better than the real thing! Thanks for sharing.",
				"oh my goodness these are amazing.  My vegan dinner guests are still talking about it!",
				"Made this today and enjoyed it for dinner. Different flavor profile than I normal go for and I appreciated the change, ate it on a tortilla instead of making pancakes. The only thing I'd do different next time is reduce the soy sauce, even with low sodium soy sauce I found it a bit salty for my taste, but no worries, I'll just tweak it next time, there'll definitely be a next time. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!",
				"This recipe is soooo yummy!  Have made a few of your recipes now and they are all A+++. Thanks for the unique takes on some of my old favourites. I made my own pancakes too as I live in a tiny village in Bavaria where the local tastes are rather mild and the shops are quite limited. Will definitely be making these again very soon.",
				"Hi,Just discovered your site and have been enjoying it.  Thank you.  A couple of questions about this recipe.  What size tins for the jackfruit? Also, would I have to go to Chinatown to get the pancakes (I live in Montreal) or do most Asian supermarkets carry them?  Could soft flour tortillas be substituted? Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania,I doubled the recipe and to the Jackfruit \"Duck\" I added 2 chopped serrano peppers for heat.  I also added a handful of Thai basil leaves during the last five minutes of cooking.  I  served it with green onions, sesame seeds and chopped cilantro leaves sprinkled on top and  accompanied by cooked Jasmine rice.  It was delicious!!  I had two friends over for dinner and they loved it too.  Next time, I will try it with the pancakes.  Thank you again for this awesome recipe.",
				"I also totally fell in loooooooove whith Peking Duck, when I ate it first in an original Peking Duck restaurant. What a delight to find a vegetarian version (being a vegetarian sinve 16 years now. I have tried other things with Jackfruit and find it a wonderful substitude for all kind of meat dishes but never thought about duck substitude. Thank you so much Ania  for this recipe  _()_    I for sure will make it soon!  greetings from Denver Magdalena",
				"Hi Ania,Such an ingenious recipe!  It will be a great substitute for one of my favorite Thai dishes.  At a local Thai restaurant I order Tofu Duck Basil - it looks like after pressing the tofu, it is cooked in Thai basil sauce, then it is fleshed out and so it looks like duck meat.   It is delicious.  I have not been able to find any details about how to make tofu have theconsistency and appearance of duck meat .  Thank you for this recipe.  I am convinced that it will help me satisfy a craving."

				"1. Cut aubergines / eggplants into 3-4 thick slices and then each slice into wedges lengthwise.",

				"3. Sprinkle the aubergine / eggplant pieces with a thin layer of cornflour / cornstarch. You can either use a small sieve for this (or a tea strainer) or a large ziplock bag although I prefer the former as it\u2019s kinder on the environment. If using a bag, place aubergine pieces and cornflour in it. Zip up and shake the contents well to coat the aubergine.",

Once the oil warms up, place the aubergine / eggplant pieces in the pan and fry until gently charred on the outside and cooked through. Rotate the pieces around the pan to make sure they brown evenly on all sides. You may need to fry the aubergine in batches if your pan is small. Once ready, set aside.",

				"I made this yesterday and it was super delicious! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe",
				"I just made this today and it is a flavour packed recipe!  We loved it! I did not sprinkle cornstarch on the eggplant and fry it in oil. Instead, I baked the eggplant pieces on 400F for 15 min. I make double batch of the sauce and added tofu pieces and baked eggplant. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you!",
				"Amazing recipe. Tastes just like my fav dish  that I order for take out. Perfect balance of flavours. Big hit with the family. Will definitely make this again.",
				"This was delicious!!",
				"I usually prepare aubergines \"mediterannean style\" (read South of France or Italy or Greece or Middle east)  with the occasional miso glaze, but this recipe is going to be a welcome new addition for me during Summer! It's delicious ! I did not have any fresh chili or spring onion, so I replaced the spring onions with shallots and chinese chive, and infused the oil with thai chili instead, and it was great. Thank you for the recipe.",
				"Absolutely delicious!",
				"I got some clearance eggplants at the store and was trying to figure out what to do with them. I made this recipe and it's SO GOOD, thank you so much for this. I literally cannot stop eating it. I'm trying to put it away and keep stealing pieces out of the pan and the container",

That is why I love being vegan, cook something, have leftovers and turn that into something else that is delicious ;)Also love your dessert recipes!! Gosh I have to try some of those chocolate pots! Thank you for the recipes! :)",
				"Because I have a hectic work schedule, I often cook several meals for the week on Sunday. This Sunday I made this dish, but as I needed to stretch the dish for at least a few days over the week, I added tofu, fresh asparagus, and green, yellow, and orange peppers. Of course, that meant doubling the heavenly sauce. Then I had to stop myself from eating it all on Sunday night so I would have leftovers during the week. It is a wonderful dish, both fresh and reheated, and one I am sure I will make often. Thank you for the delicious recipe.",

				"1. Place smooth peanut butter, maple syrup and coconut cream in a medium bowl. Whisk with a wire whisk until you obtain a uniform mixture. Don\u2019t panic if the mixture appears to seize halfway through, it happened to me on two occasions but more vigorous mixing recovered it. If mixing doesn\u2019t help, add a tiny splash of water and whisk some more.",
				"2. Place aquafaba in a clean (that\u2019s very important as any grease residue will prevent the aquafaba from foaming) glass or metal bowl. Add vinegar (or lemon juice). Whip it until you achieve stiff peaks \u2013 you should be able to invert the bowl and the whipped aquafaba should not budge an inch. If it does it means that it hasn\u2019t been whipped enough.",
				"3. Fold stiff aquafaba into the peanut mixture with a clean spatula until the two are well incorporated. Do it very gently as you don\u2019t want to knock too much air out while mixing. The mixture will deflate a fair bit, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal. Pour the mixture between 4 small glasses and place them in the fridge for 8 hours (or overnight) for the mousse to set.",
				"4. Once the mousse has had a chance to set, place the chopped up chocolate and almond milk in a bowl over a water bath. Set the hob on the lowest setting and allow the two to melt into each other. Do not stir until most of the chocolate has melted. Take off the heat and gently mix the two together with a wire whisk.",
				"5. Allow the ganache to cool down before topping the peanut butter mousse with it.",
				"6. Once the ganache is cool but still pourable, divide it evenly between the 4 ramekins and place them into the fridge (or freezer to speed things up) to set. Sprinkle the tops with coarse sea salt just before serving."

				"Hey! This was very yum but I think I did something wrong, after about 2 hours in the fridge the aquafaba mix deflated almost leaving big bubbles in its place. I was thinking that maybe it was because I used crunchy peanut butter but cant be sure, would love to know the answer!",
				"My first time working with chickpea water so i was a little worried but this was rather easy, set beautifully (so airy!!) and was a hit with my peanut butter addict boyfriend. Thanks for another great recipe. Sara",
				"Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! I LOVE peanut butter and it was the first time I used aqua faba. Absolutely worth trying\ud83d\udc97",
				"Oh. My. Goodness!!! Winner winner vegan dinner! I made this mousse with the salted ganache for Thanksgiving (in individual jars) and had to sneak a sample. My aquafaba whipped marvelously and everything came together as described. So easy! The biggest challenge is waiting for it to set! So yummy. Happy Thanksgiving!!",
				"Sound so yummy. Can it be made ahead and frozen?",
				"Amazing recipe!  I made the peanut part the night before and left in fridge overnight  (as suggested)  put in old Gu pots and they look so professional! Will be making these over and over!",
				"Thank you very much for the recipe !The mousse was ok until i put the chocolat ganache on.. ^^'It melted and some of the chocolat licked to the bottom. (The ganache was xold though..)But still, it was very yummy !! I didnt put any sweatener but the chocolat :)",
				"I've been meaning to leave a review of this for ages. It's one of my favourite desserts and I made it for so many people when hosting, many of them weren't even vegan, and it gets rave reviews each time. Thank you for yet another excellent recipe, Ania!",
				"Hi Ania! This looks like it will be fantabulous! Question ~ I have cans of coconut cream; I assume that's ok to use instead of the cream that rises to the top of the milk?  Seems like it should be the same stuff. SO looking forward to making this as I really miss Reese's PB cups.",
				"This dessert is a hit in our home. Thank you for sharing it. Very easy to put together and my guest just love it.  Give it a try, especially if you love peanut butter.",
				"Admittedly I am a biggest fan of peanuts butter, but it was the greatest dessert every including non vegan deserts! You are some kind of a genius woman!!! :-)",
				"This is sooooo good! The texture is gorgeous, and the flavour is spot on. Best vegan mousse I\u2019ve made. My non vegan husband loved it too!",
				"This is why I cry when aquafaba goes down the drain. Thank you for teaching us how to use this product! I\u2019ve made this recipe many times and it never disappoints. Everyone loves it and no one knows how it\u2019s made unless I brag about it.",
				"This recipe was easy to make and the result was out of this world!, tastes just like a peanut buttercup!..I will definitely make it again and again",
				"Omg this peanut butter mousse was sooooooo good. I wish i had taken pictures of it but it got over before I could take any photos. Such a delicious recipe and its vegan! Thats the best combination ever!!!",
				"I'm a big lover of peanut butter and chocolate combination and this dessert really delivered. I was worried about working with chickpea brine but it worked a charm (thank you for your detailed instructions) and the texture of the mousse was delightful. My husband and kids could not get enough and I am excited to make it for my non-vegan dinner guests soon. Thank you for this beautiful recipe, Ania!",
				"This recipe is simply amazing!I've never tried aquafaba before, but it's a king of magic!Peanut butter butter mousse is so creamy  and luscious!I just had a techincal problem pouring the chocolate ganache\ud83d\ude05It's better to refrigerate the mousse before otherwise chocolate can't stay on top and the result is not perfect!Ania your blog is absolutely \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d",
				"Have made this \ud83e\udd5c butter chocolate mousse a couple of times and it is soooooo satisfying \ud83d\ude02 .  Aquafaba is magic!  And no \ud83d\udc25 suffered here. Thank you Ania \ud83d\udc93",
				"This. Peanut. Butter. Mousse. Is. Beyond!Such a simple recipe with maximum flavour. Can\u2019t wait to make it again during the holidays!",
				"Amazing! Thank you for sharing this recipe. My family and friends are going nuts over it. So easy and delish.",
				"It looks great! Though when I gave it a try,  the peanut butter mixture did not hold stable after staying overnight in the fridge. Could it be because my coconut cream was rather liquidish? Anyway, I am trying to put them in the freezer, see if I can save it. Wish me luck! :)",
				"Can't wait to try this!  I wonder if you could substitute agave syrup or powdered sugar instead of the maple syrup?  We're not vegan, but during COVID getting creative with new recipes and wasting nothing.  Finally motivation to try aquafaba!",
				"I don't normally have coconut cream so I  added 2 tablespoons coconut oil and one tablespoon coconut milk and it worked \ud83d\ude0aAlso, I sweetened with agave nectar.",
				"hello it looks great.what is aquafaba",
				"How do you make the alternative ganache? Just mix all of those ingredients together? No heat?",
				"Just so I'm clear, the peanut butter mousse has to set in the fridge for 8 hours BEFORE being topped with the cooled ganache - is that right? And then it has to go back in the fridge for another 3-4 hours.  Is there any way to speed up the process?",
				"You are great ! Glad I found you   Thanks so much for sharing    Blessings",
				"Hiya omg these look amaasszzzing can\u2019t wait to try them! Ive never heard of the egg substitute you used but I think I\u2019m gonna try use egg whites... also do you know the nutritional info on this? Like how many calories are in each one? Thanks so much!",
				"Do you know if an alternative to aquafaba can be used? I can't find a place to buy it where I live",
				"Okay, thanks. Reading this recipe was the first time I'd ever heard of aquafaba, but I'll be sure to give that a go :)",
				"The Mousse is really delicious but unluckly the ganache is a bit too heavy and sinks to the bottom but over all it is a really simple and tasty dessert.\ud83e\udd24",
				"I have one question :))How long should I leave the dessert with the chocolate ganache in the fridge ?",
				"I would like to know how long it stays fresh tasting in the refrigerator and it is could be frozen in a Christmas Buche de Noel?  Some of my experiments with aqua faba havecollapsed after one day.",
				"I just made this but I can tell it's going to be grainy. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dI followed your recipe exactly and used coconut cream from trader Joe's. Was that possibly the reason?",
				"Hi Ania, it's the Costco brand. I realized that as soon as i mixed it with the maple syrup and coconut cream it turned grainy (almost like wet sand). Even before I added It to the aquafaba. It wasnt creamy like how your picture shows above.It still turned out delicious though haha.",
				"Do you think cashew butter instead of peanut butter would work?   (I usually always have clean cashew butter in house... but I could buy peanut butter) This sounds so dang good.  I gotta make it.",
				"I used natural peanut butter, which had oil in it, and when I mixed it with the whipped aquafaba it deflated and became watery! Will this set up still, or did I flop.? Your photos look so delicious I really want to try it!",
				"Thanks for replying! My Aquafina did pass the upside down test. I am going to assume I under mixed the he peanut butter and oil. I froze them and ate, delicious flop!",
				"Is there any way to use sweetened Pb and maybe reduce the syrup or something? I never buy unsweetened so hoping to use what I have! Either way, I'm definitely going to give these a try.",
				"Can this be doubled and still set?Also can it be poured into one large container instead of individual ones and still set? Thanks!",
				"Hi Ania,This sounds delicious!   Just one question:  By coconut cream, do you mean the top portion you get after putting a can of  full fat coconut milk in the fridge overnight?",
				"I made this for my non vegan friends at my dinner party and they were literally licking out the ramekin! It is absolutely delicious! Nothing better than chocolate and peanut butter!  It was so fluffy and just simply delicious!Oh man, being Vegan is tough haha! Thank you for sharing your recipe and your passion!",
				"These photos are very appealing x) I'm craving for these even though I never had them (at least not just yet, cause I'll sure make this recipes!)",
				"What could I use in place of the coconut? We have a coconut allergy...:\ud83e\udd14",
				"Can you use egg white for the mousse?",
				"Aargh!! This is *exactly* what I want to make with my next batch of AF. It looks sooooo good.",
				"Just yum. Thank you for releasing this pattern early and thanks, especially, for the tips about what to do if it looks like things are going wrong. That's so helpful!"

Whilst they were still superb, I chose this recipe because of how vibrant they were. Cannot wait to order the rice paper and to try again. A few followers on my Insta would like the recipe, can I copy and paste this recipe for them, including links to your site, or would you prefer if it was just the link and social media links etc. ?

						"1. Heat up a heavy-bottomed pot (a frying pan will be too shallow for this amount of sauce) and pour 2-3 tbsp of olive oil on the bottom.",
						"2. Once the oil warms up and starts simmering gently, add finely sliced onion. Saute on low-medium until softened, stirring from time to time (about 5 minutes total).",
						"3. Stir in chopped garlic. Saute for a few more minutes until garlic gets fragrant, but not browned.",
						"4. Stir in tomato paste and chilli paste (if using).",
						"5. Next, tip in chopped tomatoes and 500 ml / 2 cups of water. Cover with a lid and allow the sauce to come to a gentle simmer.",
						"6. Simmer covered for about 1 hour, until the tomatoes lose their firmness and become mushy.",
						"7. Next, take the lid off and simmer for another hour or so, giving the sauce a good stir every 20 minutes or so, especially towards the end as the sauce thickens and can therefore burn more easily.",
						"8. Season with salt, pepper, sugar and dried herbs. Take off the heat when the sauce has still retained a little bit of moisture  (don\u2019t let it dry out too much) and allow the sauce to cool before assembling your lasagna."

					"AUBERGINES / EGGPLANTS": [
						"1. Cut aubergines / eggplants into 2 cm / 0.75\u2033 thick slices lengthwise.",
						"2. Salt each slice (especially where the seeds are) with salt and place in a colander in a sink or over a large dinner plate / tray. Allow to sit for 30-60 minutes. The salting step is not always necessary as these days aubergines are hardly even bitter, but it is a precaution you may want to take just in case, especially when cooking for guests.",
						"3. Rinse the salt off under the tap and pat aubergine / eggplant slices dry with a kitchen towel.",
						"4. Heat up the oven to 225\u00b0 C / 435\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"5. Place dry aubergine / eggplant slices on a tray (you may need to do that in two batches) and bake for about 30 minutes \u2013 until they get softer and lightly golden."
					]
				},
				{
					"BECHAMEL": [
						"1. Place rinsed cashews in an upright blender with approximately 360 ml / 1\u00bd cup water. Blend until smooth and creamy.",
						"2. Add garlic, miso paste, nutritional yeast, nutmeg, salt and pepper and process until super smooth and creamy.",
						"3. Just before assembly, transfer cashew bechamel to a medium pot and place on a hob. Whisk in tapioca starch with a wire whisk. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer whisking the whole time. Simmer until the bechamel thickens. If the sauce is too thick (it should be thick but still pourable) whisk in a bit more water."

						"2. Line the bottom of the dish with aubergine / eggplant slices. Choose the meatier / thicker pieces if you haven\u2019t managed to make them all identical.",
						"3. Next, spread about a cup of tomato sauce followed by lasagna sheets.",
						"4. Spread about a cup of tomato sauce followed by another layer of aubergine / eggplant.",

				"Great ideas! Thank you!",
				"This is so delicious! Best sauce ever. But my body doesnt love cashews, is there another nut that would work?",
				"Also, is tapioca starch the same as tapioca flour? Thanks!",
				"This looks delicious! I'm going to give it a go for family dinner next weekend. Just wanted to ask, can I prepare it all a day in advance, and then only bale it in the day? Our is it best to assemble it all on the day? Thanks!",
				"This is my favourite dinner recipe and I keep coming back to it whenever I have a little bit more time for cooking. My partner (who isn\u2019t vegan) loves it too. I make my lasagna with canned tomatoes and usually use less cans than the recipe suggests (3-4) and it turns out perfect.  The bechamel sauce is way better than any other vegan lasagna sauce  I have ever tried (and I tried many). Thank you, Ania for sharing this and other delicious  recipes with us. \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019m a big fan.",
				"This recipe looks delicious! Is it okay to freeze for batch cooking / leftovers?  Any special tips or instructions?  Thanks!",
				"Hi thereThis looks delicious Can I substitute the cashews with another nut?For some reason cashews don\u2019t agree with me (I am so sad about this -  just saying)Thanks Rosie",
				"Just made this. OMG! Excellent. Delicious. Can't stop eating it!!! It is the lasagna I've been looking for forever. What's even more amazing is that mine actually looks just like yours. Ha!",
				"This was an absolute dream of a lasagna.I didn't use aubergines, not because I'm one of those weirdos who don't like them, but because I wanted the dish to be totally distinct from your lovely moussaka. I also added lentils, as suggested ,and a layer of spinach, which I've always liked in a lasagna. I used your moussaka (\"Mr Cauliflower\") bechamel because my wife is allergic to the cashew nuts in the topping you outline here. My one gripe is aesthetic - the bechamel cracked up quite a lot and separated in a sort of continental drift effect. Do you know what might cause that?  I suspect I got the portions of oil/cauli/soya milk wrong (btw, I can't use the recommended almond milk due to the allergy issue; and I didn't use the optional  nutritional yeast). Having botched a few in my time, I always get a bit stressed  when I make a bechamel - and have usually had too much wine by that stage of preparation - so I'm not sure whether I followed the directions properly. Any thoughts? I'll give the recipe a 5 if I can sort this out. Cheers - David",
				"Hi, could I make this in advance and freeze it?  Thank you",
				"This vegan lasagna seems to be delicious. However, making a sauce for this is a bit time-consuming but still awesome one. I will definitely try this in my kitchen for my family!!",
				"Oh my goodness, this Lasagna tastes sooo delicious! I have to admit that I ate two portions because I couldn't stop. ; )Okay, it really takes some time to prepare everything, but I promise it is worth it.I made my last Lasagna when I was still vegetarian & thought without cheese I will not try it again in a vegan version. And I was never a big fan of Bechamel, but this great cashew based Bechamel is so tasty on top. This is definitely a great dish when you have guests.Thanks for this new recipe, Ania! I will post pictures on instagram.",
				"This looks amazing! I just don't have any tapioca starch at home, and I wouldn't really know what to use it for except for this great recipe....do you think I could replace it with psyllium husk powder, as it is also used to thicken sauces etc.? The fotos really made me want to try this lasagna asap  :-)",
				"My kids are not interested in eating vegetables they just want fast food, now I decide to put something spicy at home. I follow your recipes.",
				"I cannot wait to try this!  Just canned 9 quarts of spaghetti sauce made with fresh tomatoes so part of the recipe is already done.  LOVE eggplant!",
				"There doesn't seem to be any where near enough bechamel for the rest of the ingredients. Also it is quite thick then i have to add tapioca i feel like it's going to end up like glue..? Should i be adding more luquid when i simmer with the tapioca?",
				"You lost me on eggplant,any substitute?",
				"Approximately what is the weight of four of your eggplants? They are so varied in size. This recipe looks amazing and I cannot wait to make it!",
				"Oh. My. Gosh. The pictures are enough to make me drop what I'm doing and start preparing this lasagna. Thank you for what looks to be another heavenly recipe. Can't wait to try it."

					"PASTRY CASES": [
						"1. Combine flour, icing sugar, (plus cornstarch and xanthan gum if making GF pastry) in a large bowl. If using maple syrup instead of icing sugar, don\u2019t add it just yet. Add the softened coconut oil and rub it into the dry ingredients with your fingers until your flour looks like breadcrumbs and there are no lumps of coconut oil left.",
						"2. If you are using maple syrup, add it now and the chances are that you will not need to add any water to bring the dough together. If using icing sugar, add cold water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is. I added about 4 tbsp / \u00bc cup. Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it up in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
						"3. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out between two sheets of baking paper until you get a circle large enough to cover your entire tart case, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Place the rolled-out dough over a tart case and gently line the inside of it with the pastry. Tuck the pastry in well, ensuring that it fits snugly into all the nooks and crannies. Trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife and patch any holes with the cut-off excess. If making gluten-free pastry (which tends to be more crumbly), you may be better off placing the crumbled pastry in the tart case and simply moulding the pastry with your hands to the shape of the tart tin \u2013 you do not need to worry about overworking the pastry as it contains no gluten.",
						"4. Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places and chill the pastry-lined tart case in the fridge for about another 60 minutes.",
						"5. 45 min into pastry chilling time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line the pastry case with a large piece of crumpled baking paper and fill with baking beads or rice for a blind bake.",
						"6. Blind bake the pastry for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beads and bake for another 10 minutes."
					]
				},
				{
					"FILLING": [
						"1. While the pastry cases are baking, prepare the filling. Cream oil and sugar (or maple syrup) with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Add aquafaba, one tablespoon at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"2. Finally, gently fold in the almond meal, zest and almond essence with a spatula. You should end up with a thick batter (it will be a bit less thick if you used maple syrup instead of sugar).",
						"3. Fill the pastry case with almond frangipane and use a silicon spatula to spread the filling evenly. Place the fig quarters on top \u2013 don\u2019t worry about them sticking above the level of the filling \u2013 the filling will rise during baking a fair bit.",
						"4. Bake the tart for about 50-60 minutes, until the filling is nicely browned. I found that the maple syrup filling tends to take a little longer in the oven (by 10 minutes or so). Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool down before removing it from the tin and cutting it into slices. The top will crisp up nicely as the tart cools down."

I was very skeptical about this vegan frangipane, but it turned out amazing. Everyone loved it and the whole tart was gone within minutes! Such an impressive recipe. Thank you for sharing all of your recipes.",
				"Hello! This recipe looks beautiful and I\u2019m eager to try it! Wanted to ask if you think it\u2019s ok to make a day ahead or if it\u2019s better to make the pastry & bake it and then freeze the filling, thaw it bake day, and then bake it. Thanks for your help!",
				"Just coming back here to report that I made it with chia egg and it turned out fantastic! I swapped the aquafaba with 15 grams chia and 75 grams water, let it soak for a bit, and then blended them until it became an almost-smooth eggy looking past. I was worried it will give the creme a grey-ish tone but after backing I could barely see any difference. I\u2019m really happy it worked cause while the results  using aquafaba are great, chia is more accessible. So it\u2019s nice to have that option",
				"Hi Ania,Looks great! What\u2019s the roll of aquafaba here? If it is to glue the whole thing together, do you think I could use chia egg?",
				"Love this recipe. Did it with walnuts instead of almonds and subbed the essence & lemon rind for cinnamon--- was sublime and I love the texture of the frangipane. Will be a go-to I think",
				"In reply to Barry Pines comment (although quite a while back now \ud83d\ude06) on his mixture looking thicker than it should be, well from my own experience not all ground almonds are the same (not sure how this is when you grind them yourself)  and almonds from one supermarket work well with my own recipe for Bakewell tart whereas from another supermarket I need to add in more water and oil \ud83e\udd14 quite strange \ud83d\ude04",
				"Hello. I would like to make this amazing looking tart, but I do not have Aquafaba... Could I substitute it for something else?Thank you.",
				"Yum! Want to make this tomorrow - can I use virging coconut oil instead of refined coconut oil?",
				"Made this for a vegan friend's birthday- WOW, it's amazing. I can't stop eating the cut-off pastry edges, they're so yummy!",
				"Hi!I am looking to make this delicious tart for a birthday cake and I am wondering if I could make any elements of this tart ahead of time? Maybe the pastry and leave it uncooked in the fridge? I will be making the gluten-free version. Alternatively, do you know if it would still be ok to make the day before and would I store it in the fridge? Many thanks :)",
				"Thank you for taking the time to reply :) I thought I'd share my pie making experience- I didn't have xanthan gum or coconut oil (oops) so I used chia seeds and vegan butter in the pastry. I also used fresh cherries instead of the figs. I think I cooked it for a little too long but it's really delicious and the pastry (although a bit overcooked) is lovely! I'm so excited as it was my first time making pastry, gluten free or otherwise. I served it with coconut yoghurt and it was thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
				"I am trying to make this tart and I notice that the orange zest and the almond essence are not mentioned in the instructions.  I just threw them in the filling mix at the end and I'm hoping for the best.  Also, my filling came out more like wet sand than batter.  Is this how it is supposed to be, or is there some other liquid that should be added?  Thank you.",
				"I did cream the oil and sugar using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment until it was thick and creamy and homogeneous.  It just seemed that 1/3 cup of olive oil and 3/8 cup of aquafaba did not provide enough moisture for the 2 1/2 cups of almond meal.  I did taste it prior to baking and it was delicious, but after baking, it looks like it has the consistency of the crumb top of a coffee cake. I did not want to cut into it because I'm saving it for Thanksgiving.  I'm sure it will taste wonderful and the texture will not be bad, just not like what was in your pictures, so I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.",
				"Ania,I'm going to make this tart with pears and take it to Macmillan coffee morning. I'm a massive fan of frangipani but this will be my first attempt \ud83d\ude00.I'm also going to modify a traditional recipe into a vegan one now I have read your advice regarding aquafab and it makes a lot of sense. Chickpeas are on being cooked at this moment!Your blog is inspirational and full of tasty ideas. Carry on doing such great job!Love, Ewa",
				"Hi there,I'm making an almond tart using puff pastry so have been scouring the internet for  a frangipane recipe that does not involve vegan butter (hate the taste and texture of it). Your recipe seems like just what I'm looking for. However, I have one concern that you might be able to help with. Puff pastry cooks very quickly and given that the frangipane will be encased in it there is no real option to slow down the baking of the pastry as the frangipane cooks. As such, I am fearful of the only thing as bad as vegan butter: raw flour. Do you have any suggestions that might save me from my predicament and bring almond tarts back into my life?Thanks in advance.",

I sprinkled some flaked almonds on top and used regular almond extract and my partner said it reminded him of a cherry bakewell, so it didn\u2019t even matter thar the majority of the plums sank. I\u2019m going to attempt to bake it in a pastry case and add some cherries to lean in to the bakewell vibe. I did worry that the sunken plums would make the cake too moist, but everyone loved it.",

				"Awesome I've been using the coconut milk and lemon base to create a few different caked now and it works amazingly. Thankyou so much",
				"So unbelievably fluffy- can\u2019t believe it\u2019s gluten free! Sifting the flours was definitely worth it.I didn\u2019t have buckwheat flour, so replaced it with 50-50 mix of blended oats and quinoa.Also didn\u2019t have almond essence, so I took inspiration from your loaf recipe an used cardamom. Also, used erythritrol to make it sugar free. In the end, it still worked out beautifully, as all your recipes do!",
				"Hi Ania, I have just made this plum cake and it came out amazing. Many thanks for sharing this recipe. I will certainly make it again soon.",
				"This recipe is amazing. Super simple and easy to follow instructions. I used plums from my allotment, great way to use up surplus fruit. I used oat milk  instead of coconut milk and spelt flour instead of plain and almond flour. I would try using almond flour next time to give a nutty flavour. I received lots of compliments when serving this cake. I made it twice in two days! The cake is super moist, subtly sweet and fluffy!  Thank you for such a great recipe Lazy Cat Kitchen!",
				"This turned out so great! I followed the recipe to the letter (for once!).A very beautiful and delicious cake!Perfection as always from @lazycatkitchenxxx",
				"Hi Ania! Just made this cake (GF version) and the texture and flavor of the cake is on point! Fluffy, moist, delicious, just wonderful. I made two slight variations and I have a question for you. The first is that I put about a 1/2 tsp salt as I have a preference for baked goods, esp cake, to have some salt. The second variation I made was to add a tiny pinch of cardamom powder, as this spice accentuates the fruitiness in a recipe ( Froot Loops purportedly contained this spice as a secret ingredient.) My question for you: How do you keep the plums from sinking? I dusted the side of the plums that touched the batter with cornstarch, but they still sunk. Seems that this is a finicky art to nail, since that's why you made this cake so many times. If you would share any tricks you learned in the process this would be so appreciated. The beauty of this cake is the plums on top, like your pictures, and I hope for some insight into how to achieve this \"work of art\" look!",
				"Loved this recipe! It was moist and delicious. I will be making this with different fruit and using it a base for many other flavours! Thank you..",
				"Thanks for the awesome recipe. So light and fluffy and a great use for our plum harvest.",

				"We made this and it was AMAZING! So light and creamy. The tip about not over mixing was very helpful, that's my downfall with vegan cakes and this one wasn't tough or dense at all. Thanks for your recipes, they are the best!",

I have a lot of German heritage and  have enjoyed your updates to classic recipes. \ud83d\ude0a~Summer",
				"This looks delicious and I will be trying it this week but can you let me know if the cake can be frozen?   I have a cake fayre at the beginning of October and would love to take this along.",
				"Thank you for your reply! I believe I used just one tsp of baking soda and I mixed it with the dry ingredients. My oil was sunflower oil first cold press. I did replace a little bit of buckwheat flour (because it was the first time ever I was going to eat it) for whole wheat flour that I regularly use in baking (organic, ultra-fine, lovely brand). It went 3/4 cup of almond meal, 1/2 cup buckwheat and 1 cup of whole wheat to the batter.  We loved the texture of the cake! I believe I will be trying the regular version soon and maybe do some other experiment not vegan (so I can discard the baking soda idea) with the buckwheat.  They say so many marvelous things about the buckwheat that I really hope it is not that I just do not like it ;)All the best,Silvana",
				"Hello Ania from Buenos Aires, Argentina! I've just tried your recipe with the buckwheat version, just because I wanted to introduce this flour into our diet. It turned out beautiful and perfect. Almost like the picture! hehe But I did not like the taste (ooo). Could it be I just do not like the buckwheat? It was really bitter and almost salty. The other explanation for me would be the baking soda (I never use this much), but I am not sure about this...Cheers,Silvana",
				"Excellent recipe, tastes great, my son went straight into the tin with a spoon! Been vegan for 2 years and only just discovered your blog, very much appreciating the Polish influences! Thank you :)",

				"i always try to increase whole grains in my baking and often substitute it for some (not all) of the white flour.  Can i do this here, using either white whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour?  Say a quarter or a third?Thanks.",
				"Hi Ania, looks amazing! I want to try this recipe but can I use something other than almond meal? I have flax, cashews, walnuts, peanuts, coconut - would any of these ground up into meal work as a substitute? I\u2019m going to make coconut milk from scratch for this anyway so I\u2019m wondering if I could use some of the leftover pulp in this recipe.Can I also omit baking powder and increase baking soda and lemon juice? I don\u2019t use baking powder. Thanks!",
				"Amazing recipe! Really easy to make and tastes awesome :) Thanks \u00e0 lot for sharing it :)",
				"I just found your website after looking for a vegan plum cake recipe, and I am so glad that I did! Here is a tip if you ensure that you have a nice moist cake, add some vegetable glycerine to the batter, My mother got this tip from a French pastry chef and always used it and it works!",
				"I bake often and tried the gluten free version and it just did not rise and was very tough so sadly it went in the bin, although I saved the plums so I can try again.",
				"delicious, I can not wait to eat that",
				"I made the gluten-free version today with Italian prune plums and it was quite good.   I really enjoyed it and my mom loved it too.  We both loved the lemon-almond flavor of the cake, and the buckwheat was very satisfying and hearty - an interesting choice for the gluten-free flour.  The plums were incredible in this cake.  Out-of -this-world.  I  ate 2 big slices about 7 hours ago and I'm still not hungry.  Usually when I eat cake, my blood sugar goes all out of whack and I'm shaky and famished an hour later.    I feel good about this cake.  I'll make it again.   I was thinking about making muffins next time and keeping them in the freezer.",
				"Hi Ania,What size baking tin should we use?Thank you!",
				"I made the gluten free version this morning and used nectarines as I didn't have any plums!  The cake is delicious and  I've already eaten a third of it!  :-D",
				"Lovely as always Ania ;)The rebellious plum and your pep talk about team work have made my day hahaI have only a bit ground almond left but will go ahead and give this a try!",
				"Haha! Great story. Love that the plums responded to your pep talk. Also, I really want to know how you got icing sugar on the cake but not on the plums?!",
				"Hi, I have to avoid coconut products. Would this work with either dairy milk or plant milk? Thanks"

Sometimes just lettuce (for a very bare-bones lunch), but sometimes also tomates, chickpeas, grated carrots or some kind of leftovers. When potatoes are cut in pieces, they cook very fast (about 10 minutes). So it's quite a simple and easy lunch to prepare. The layering in a jar first resulted out of necessity as I didnt have any plastic Tupperware around. But I love the look of the layers in a jar!

				"5. Roll the dough into a long snake away from yourself and then coil it gently (see photos in the post above). Set aside to rest while you tackle the remaining 3 portions of the dough in the same manner.",
				"6. After the first coil has had a chance to rest, roll it out into a circular pancake on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle the top of the pancake with a bit of flour (before you start rolling) to stop the scallions getting stuck to the rolling pin. Don\u2019t roll the pancake out too thin as it will become dry and brittle after cooking, make it just under 1 cm / 0.4 \u201d thick. It\u2019s okay if some scallions start poking out through the dough or if there are small tears in the dough.",
				"7. Heat up 2 teaspoons of peanut oil in a medium, non-stick frying pan on a low-medium heat. Once the oil gets hot, gently place the pancake on the pan. Allow it to cook for about 3 minutes, then flip over to the other side using a spatula. After another 2 minutes, flip again. Continue flipping every 2 minutes to ensure the scallions poking through do not burn and the pancake gets evenly browned on both sides and cooks through inside \u2013 it takes about 8-10 minutes to for each pancake to cook.",
				"8. Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.",
				"9. Cut each pancakes into 6 triangles using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife. Serve warm with the dipping sauce on the side."

As well as spreading the rice evenly, keep on pressing it into the mat with the back of a spoon.",

Divide half of the coffee between two glasses and pour the other half in the blender (both a power blender and a cheap blender will work here, the difference is that ice may not get crushed as much in a low-power blender). Add a touch of maple syrup (or sugar) if you like your coffee sweetened.",

				"This is really lovely! Especially in the scorching heat. I really like the layers in the glass \ud83e\udd29",
				"Oh this sounds delicious. I have never tried cardamom in my coffee. It's definitely something I will try. Thanks for the suggestion :)",
				"Hi Ania! Well written blog. :-) It makes the reader immediately want a Freddo Cappuccino. :-) Could you please tell me where you got those beautiful pictures of Freddo Cappucciono included in your text? We would love to use it as well. Thank you!",
				"Dear Ania,Thank you for your kind reply. I would like to ask you to find a solution for us to use one of your pictures on a box of milk product, which we produce for making the Freddo Cappuccino. It would be a real pleasure to be able to use your picture and we definitely would pay for the picture.Thank you in advance.",
				"I know it sounds weird, but may I know the weight of the 20 ice cubes? Sometimes they have completely different sizes so your 20 ice cubes could equal my 10 or even 30 :DThanks!",
				"Thanks for the information and little slice of life into your country. I recently visited Greece and got through the hot afternoons with an espresso or cappuccino  freddo. Now I have my family enjoying them at home. In your research with local vendors, what is the milk they are using to get that stiff, frothy foam? I confirmed with one barista that it is skim milk, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just any skim milk.\u201d Unfortunately, he moved on from there back to his busy line of coffee drinkers waiting for their orders. Is there a special Greek skim milk? I\u2019m hoping, like you, that I can use the blenders/mixers/frothers I already have to at least get close to what I enjoyed so much in Greece (Mytilene).",
				"Curious as to whether this would work just as well with cold brew ??",
				"Fantastic riff on my usual cold brew! I'm loving it. I did use cold brew for the expresso, however, out of sheer laziness...it was in the fridge. Must try with cardamom pods some time! I used a little simple syrup to not add any additional flavor, but so refreshing this am!  Thank you. We are deciding where to travel next in Europe and Greece is very tempting, any suggestions would be appreciated!!",
				"I miss Greece so much i will definitely try your recipe and am a fan of cardamoms. I will try infusing the pods in the hot coffee while it sits.",
				"How much coffee tho? Can't wait to try it.",
				"I order mine with 'oligh\"  \u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03b7 -it's supposed to be half the sugar of metrio...! Still hit or miss, but it hits the spot most of the time!",
				"THIS is the very very best!  With little or no sugar, it is still elegant and just the right thing.  NOW I really have to make time to enjoy it in the manner it was designed:  sitting down and savoring the moment.THANK YOU!!!!  :- )",
				"Oh! Looks like the perfect drink to cool down with!",
				"I've already voted for you both, definitely deserve a trophy \ud83d\ude09",
				"Sounds so nice and you was so descriptive of Greece I could really picture it :) Ice coffee is my fav drink in summer. Could you tell your measurements on making the actual black coffee or expresso part. I always seem to either do too weak or too strong when I make it myself  haha",
				"Once again, Ania, you've taken the ordinary up a notch. Iced coffee is my drink of choice in the summer months, but I drink it plain or with a dash of coconut milk if I need a little more \"body\" to the drink. But I don't need to drink it plain anymore. Your simple recipe doesn't take a lot of time and it allows me to imagine I'm sitting seaside at an outdoor cafe in Greece. :)"

				"1. Set the oven to 180\u00b0 C.",

				"9. Spoon the filling into the vegetables, but be sure not to overfill \u2013 the mixture should be roughly level with the cut so that there is room for expansion under the tops. Give the mixture a good stir between filling each vegetable so that you distribute the liquid that drops to the bottom evenly between all vegetables. Put the tops back on.",

				"11. Put the baking tray (or trays) into an oven. After about 1 hour, protect the tops from burning by wrapping a piece of aluminium foil over them. Continue baking for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through. If the rice is still a little hard at the end of the cooking time, leave the veggies in a warm (switched off) oven for another 30 minutes to finish off cooking.",
				"12. Traditionally, yemista is served at room temperature rather than warm, so allow it to cool down before eating. They\u2019re best enjoyed with a simple green salad (I use Romaine lettuce, spring onions and cucumber) and some crusty bread."

				"cooked this tonight, just stuffed peppers not stuffed tomatoes as there's only the two of us!! it was absolutely delicious and loved the addition of a bit of chilli.... didnt have any of the yeast so just used feta,got enough for tomorrow night!! served it with green salad, flat breads and whipped feta dip. Gorgeous \ud83d\ude0d",
				"I can't wait to make these! A Greek friend's Mum introduced me to Gemistas and suggested I try and make them myself! I've never heard of them before so I was intrigued and decided to try them at a Greek restaurant so now I am inspired to try and make them at home!How could I adjust the recipe so it's only stuffed peppers instead of also doing stuffed tomatoes? Not keen to do stuffed tomatoes, just stuffed peppers",
				"I LOVE  THIS RECIPE! The combination of flavours is great! The sweetness from the sultanas, peppers and tomatoes combined with the salty capers. The almonds are a great touch, I'm loving the occasional crunch. I made these for a dinner party, I love how I could make them early in the day and just relax and wait for my guests. I also added Oregano and Basil because I LOVE a bit of extra herbage \u2665\ufe0fwill definitely bake again\u2764\ufe0f",

				"So delicious. Beautiful blend of flavours. Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I love Greek food and stuffed peppers were always my favourite. We go to Greece Every year so I had lots of  yemistas over the years  and  I have to say this one is  possibly The Best. Love the combination of capers and raisins . I  didn\u2019t have any mint so used  dry oregano and flat parsley and it worked well too. Was not sure whether to use cooked or uncooked rice  but as I had  underdone rice in  stuffed peppers served in restaurants  on few occasions I decided to cook my cook my rice  and cool it down before mixing  with the other ingredients.  Can\u2019t wait to make eat them again.",
				"Thanks Ania, My guests last night were Greeks (we live on Crete), initially they found the chilli a bit of a surprise, but they also loved them too, I made loads so I've even got some leftover for tonight's supper too!  Result!",
				"Hi, I found it a bit time consuming to make and vowed not to make it again....... that is until I tasted it it! Wow wow wow, fabulous. So worth the time. Making it again tonight for guests who are coming for dinner. Thanks tons!",
				"Love this recipe. New favourite dish.",
				"Hi there!  I am planning on making these for an Easter Lunch and I was going to prepare everything the day before and then just have to bake day of.  Do you think this would work?",
				"Hey, it's me again :)) Just found your blog and can't get over it. Is it possible to replace rice with quinoa in this recipe?  If yes, should I stick to the same quantity?",
				"One more  question I have - is it ok to make those without a sauce? Would it change the way peppers and tomatoes cooks \"through\"?",
				"I did it with quinoa - it was amazing! Didn't risk making it without sauce though :)",

				"Oh thank you for this  recipe!  Dr. told me this morning , no raw food for next 60 days. Been to farmer's market over this last weekend  and was wondering what to do  with the tomatoes, peppers and onions I'd just bought. What great timing! Sad about the raw thing though...:-)",

				"This dish looks just wonderful, and it also looks easy to prepare (my favorite kind of recipe). I love the addition of the raisins! Thank you for once again finding a way to add flavor and interest to a favorite dish. Just one more reason to keep piling on the votes for your blog at the Saveur Blog Awards site! I know what dish I'll be making this weekend!"

The pineapple or pear makes the banana sweeter and creamier without being overpowering. Electric is easiest but hand cranked also works.",

				"Wow! This recipe is another winner! I found it quite heavy and couldn't finish a whole one, so might divide it into smaller portions next time. I used hazelnuts which were yum - next time I might try almonds and adding a bit of booze...",
				"Hi Ania!I really am looking forward to making this, but I have a \"nut and seed butter\" which is a blend of cashews, almonds, chia seeds, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and hazelnuts. Aside from the taste (which I'm okay with) do you think this would work in the recipe as there are bits of chia seeds which cause it to not be totally smooth? Is the smoothness of the butter a texture thing for the pudding, or will it not turn out fluffy due to the bits? I have almonds and a Vitamix, so I could make my own almond butter, but I've never done that before and would rather use what I have. Also, because the seed and nut butter is natural, it's pretty oily. Will that deflate my peaks or is this oil act differently from grease? Sorry for all the questions. I can't wait to make this!!!! Thanks!",

				"Yummmmmmm! Would a flax egg work instead of the aquafaba?Xx",
				"Hey :) Could I use carob powder instead of cacao powder? And if I use lemon juice instead of apple cider winegar, should I still use 1/2 tablespoon?It looks amazing! Looking forward to make it for my vegan friend :)",
				"Ania, I've tried it with carob powder. Worked just fine :)  It was very delicious!",
				"This was amazing! My daughter helped me make it; it was the first time either of us ever made aquafaba and we were amazed. The flavor and texture were out of this world!!!",

I have a question about the hazelnut butter (especially smooth) - it's really difficult to find it here so my first batch I'm working on right now is with smooth peanut butter. What brand did you use? Do you think your home made one would work just as well? I know it'll be chunky but I'm just wondering",
				"Hi Ania! Yes, my chocolate mousse has a peanut buttery flavor which is yummy but hazelnut would have been great... You convinced me to make my own hazelnut butter though - it will even be cheaper than buying. My food processer is a cheapo one from Lidl but it will get the job done. Btw I made the chocolate mousse this morning but it doesn't have the nice air pockets yours does. I think that I may not have whipped the AF long enough or I should have reduced the AF more (I freeze it in an ice cube tray and sometimes don't know what type it is ;)) but the texture is very creamy and lovely so far (it's been chilling for 3 hrs so far) so I'm looking forward to having it in the evening :)Ps: I entered you in the contest yesterday - good luck!",
				"The texture of this is beautiful considering it contains sweet potato! You would never have guessed.I'm bookmarking this for a later date, with the start of summer I've been over indulging on ice-cream and dessert so itll be good to have a healthier version to fall back on! Lynsey",

				"2. Place maple syrup and balsamic vinegar in a small pot. Place on a low heat and simmer for about 20 minutes until the excess moisture cooks out and you are left with a thick, syrupy dressing. Beware that the mixture will thicken a lot once it cools down. If you\u2019ve over-reduced your glaze and it is no longer pourable, add a small amount of water to bring it back. If your mixture is too thin after cooling, reduce it further.",
				"3. If you want to go the extra mile, you can roast your peaches for this salad, although that\u2019s by no means necessary, fresh peaches work beautifully too. To roast the peaches, slice each peach into 8 to 12 wedges. Heat up a griddle pan on a medium-high heat and brush it with a bit of olive oil. Once the pan is hot, place peaches on it raw side on, roast for about 2 minutes on each side until lightly charred.",
				"4. Trim the top of the fennel off, core it and slice it into very thin slices using a mandolin or a sharp knife. Place it in a small bowl, sprinkle with lemon juice and mix \u2013 this step prevents discolouration.",
				"5. Toss baby spinach, rocket, red onion and fennel in a small amount (1-2 tsp) of olive oil if you wish. Season with salt and a small amount of black pepper.",
				"6. Place salad base at the bottom of a large platter. Arrange grilled peaches on top and sprinkle with roasted almonds. Drizzle balsamic glaze on top and decorate with fresh basil and an extra grind of black pepper."

I'm not used to tzatziki being so thick but that's an easy adjustment if it ends up being necessary to thin it out. I had the tzatziki with some carrot zucchini chickpea fritters and with some vegetarian kibbeh and it was great with both.",

				"1. Wash ginger and slice it (no need to peel it) into thin slices lengthwise. Spread slices of ginger and quartered onion on a baking tray. Place under a grill / broiler (175\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F) for about 15-20 minutes to get a nice char. Keep an eye on them and flip them every 5 minutes to make sure they get charred on all sides. Let them cool and rinse under a cold tap to get rid of any flaky charred bits \u2013 you don\u2019t want them floating in your stock.",
				"2. Dry roast all the spices: cinnamon, coriander seeds, cloves and star anise in a small pan until aromatic and fragrant. Make sure you give the pan a shake very frequently as they can burn easily.",
				"3. Wash all the vegetables well. Chop (no need to peel them if scrubbed well) the carrots and apple. Slice celery stalks and chop cabbage leaves into a rough dice. Place all of them in a large pot with a lid together with charred aromatics, toasted spices, coriander stalks, shiitake mushroom and salt. Pour 1.75 l / 9 cups of water into the pot. Place the lid on and bring to a simmer. Simmer, covered, for about 60 minutes.",
				"4. Cut your tofu into equal size pieces. Place them in a shallow dish and marinate in 1 tbsp of tamari (or soy sauce) and a touch of chilli paste (I used sambal oelek). After a few minutes, flip them to the other side to make sure it\u2019s seasoned evenly.",
				"5. Fry tofu in 1-2 tbsp of hot oil (I used peanut) until golden on both sides. Blot on a piece of kitchen towel. You could also bake it, but it will take longer. Spread marinated tofu on a paper-lined baking tray and bake it in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven for about 30-40 min, flipping once half way through the baking.",
				"6. While the broth is simmering, place nutritional yeast in a measuring cup and pour 180 ml (\u00be cup) of boiling water over it. Set aside for the murkier liquid to settle at the bottom.",
				"7. Cook your noodles according to the instructions on the packet. It\u2019s worth undercooking them a touch as when they get immersed in a steaming hot broth they\u2019ll soften a little more. Instead of rice noodles, you could also use zucchini strands (zoodles) if you want a lighter meal.",
				"8. Cut beans on the diagonal. Heat up a tablespoon of oil in a small pan / wok and once hot, add sliced beans. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until cooked but still crunchy. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
				"9. Strain the broth through a fine sieve \u2013 squeeze as much liquid out of the veggies as you can. Season with lime juice (I used 2 tbsp), nutritional yeast extract (only use the clear part floating on the top, discard the murkier stuff), and tamari (soy sauce) or vegan fish sauce to taste.",
				"10. Place a cluster of noodles, a few bits of tofu and stir-fried beans in each soup bowl. Pour hot soup on top. Garnish with sliced spring onions, hot chilli slices, chilli sauce of choice (optional), fresh mint and coriander leaves."

						"1. Boil a medium pot of water on the stove. Put podded and washed beans into boiling water and simmer for about 5 minutes. After 5 minutes is up, test one to make sure the inside is cooked before draining.",
						"2. While your beans are cooking, put a few ice-cubes into a bowl of cold water. As soon as the beans are ready, drain them first and then chuck them into the bowl with icy water. This step isn\u2019t necessary, but it will ensure that the beans keep their vibrant colour.",
						"3. Shell the beans (ie remove the outer shell) by making a tiny incision at the top of the bean and pressing the inside out.",
						"4. Place shelled beans (you should get about 400 g or 2 cups), garlic, 1 tbsp of lemon juice, mint leaves and nutritional yeast into a food processor. Do not add any water as you want the filling to be as dry as possible.",
						"5. Taste and season with salt, pepper, more lemon juice and chilli powder (if using) to taste. Add enough breadcrumbs to thicken the mixture (about \u00bc cup)."
					]
				},
				{
					"DOUGH": [
						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour and turmeric. Add aquafaba and mix it into the flour. The dough will need a bit of water to come together (we used 2 tbsp / 30 ml), but be careful not to add too much as this will give you a dough that is too wet. Knead the dough for at least 5 mins and then set aside for 60 minutes under a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
						"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, take a portion of the dough (1/3 for example) and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out as thin as you can (2-3 mm), the thinner the dough the tastier the ravioli. You can obviously use a pasta machine to roll out your dough if you have one.",
						"3. Use a 5 cm / 2\u2033 cookie cutter or an upside down glass to cut out circles of the dough. Place about a teaspoon of filling on half of the cut out circles. Place another circle on top and drape it around the filling, taking care not to trap any air pockets inside. Seal the two circles of dough with your fingers. If you want them to look like mine, go around each raviolo and crimp the sealed edges with the end of a fork. Put the finished dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out. Continue in the same way until you have used up all the dough and / or all the filling.",
						"4. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Once the water boils, place 5-6 ravioli (it\u2019s important not to overcrowd the pot) in the boiling water and cook, on a rolling boil, for about 5 minutes. After the time is up, fish cooked ravioli out with a slotted spoon, shaking excess water off gently, and place them on a plate. Cook all the remaining ravioli in this way.",
						"5. To serve, saut\u00e9 2 cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil. Baste the ravioli in the garlic oil gently. Serve with a sprinkling of salt, lemon zest and some more chilli if you wish."

				"I have never commented on a blog before, but I just had to say that this was the most wonderful flavour that I have had in a long time! The combination of flavours is so amazing; try not to leave out the hot pickled mangos. It\u2019s the best and I have shared it with every foodie that I know.",
				"Great recipe!  Love Ottolenghi so much - have all the cook books. We made this last night and we had no eggplant but too many zucchinis so we used those instead and it worked out well. I got mango pickles from an Asian market nearby and finally got a chance to use them. The condiments are fantastic. Worth the work.",
				"I'm just adding a comment about zhoug. I love hot spices and made a much simpler recipe one summer. - basically green chilis, parsley and garlic with an oil and lemon dressing  - heavy on the chilis. Good in small portions as a relish. I was working as in an engineer in a factory;  when talking to one of the factory workers we found that we both loved hot food. I brought him a small jar of zhoug and he shared it with friends at work.  They did like it but they decided that I must have a cast iron  mouth , throat and stomach. :DBeing men, they didn't sample it delicately but shoveled it into their mouths.",
				"Hey love the recipes! This one was a delicious lunch!!  The only thing that would make your website even better would be adding the macros/nutritional information of your meals to the recipe!",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe, it brought back some very happy memories form when I lived in Israel over 35 years ago .",
				"This took time to make because of the different components but worth it and all the flavours were spot on. Coating the eggplant  in cornflour was a great idea to make it lightly crispy yum! I didn't have any mango chutney so used some fresh mango mixed with some lime pickle which worked well. This was a hit in a sandwich loving household. Thanks",
				"Can this be made with thai eggplant or bitter ball eggplant?   I'm searching for ways to use my CSA bounty this week.",
				"I found this on Pinterest over the weekend and just made it. Wow! It was just delicious and we will certainly be making again- very often. I did homemade pittas, just equal quantities of self raising flour and yoghurt, plus a little oregano. Then rolled out and cooked in a flat pan. Wasn\u2019t sure whether it was worth doing all the extras, but adds so much flavour.Thanks for the blog!",
				"Five stars, chef! It was steaming hot yesterday but I had already invited a bunch of people for dinner.  I didn't feel like spending too much time bent over the stove and was looking for something that had a few fun elements that I could just put together. We don't get amba here, I didn't have parsley so subbed for fresh coriander, and I couldn't find pitas at the local grocer's but got piadinas instead, and, still, it was a stellar meal. We ended with sorbet, chilled wine and fruit. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much for sharing.",
				"This was really good.  I now like eggplant!  Thanks for your recipes\ud83d\ude18",
				"Wow, thanks for this amazing take on Ottolenghi inspired dish - already a firm favourite in our family , have made it 4 times since the end of summer already and the leftover sauces are delicious with pretty much anything else. Have made just about everything in his books and like the twist you gave this one. I will be watching out for your new stuff too. Thank you.",
				"This is on my must-make list...but I have zero chance of finding mango pickle. Can you suggest a substitute?Thanks!",
				"This looks utterly delicious and so pretty! Amazing presentation. Bookmarking this for a later date! Lynsey",
				"Oh Sabich. That is our go to after beach food when in Tel Aviv.  Both my kids are living there now and taunt me with photos.  I think that your version Ania looks wonderful.  As usual the photos are stunning. Ottolengi's books really are visualy inspiring. One of my sister's in law is Syrian, one Iranian, another is Iraqi , and my my mother-in-law is Egyptian and so the meals at their houses are spectacular. All the semiotic peoples of the region have lived there for thousands of years and no one has claim over a chopped cucumber salad. Calling it Israeli is just fine.   Food should unite.",
				"I am going to try this and soon.I just would like to know why would you call a salad \"Israeli Salad\" when it has Lebanese cucumbers in it. People in the middle east have been eating this salad since the dinosaurs were roaming the plains."

Combine all the ingredients into a dough gently, but do not knead (that\u2019s important for the gluten version) or the pastry will be tough. Wrap it in a piece of cling film and chill in the fridge for 45 minutes.",

If you don\u2019t have a coffee grinder, you can use a food processor instead , but that will result in a coarser grind and therefore a less delicate frangipane.",
						"2. While the pastry cases are baking, prepare the filling. Cream oil and sugar with an electric whisk. Next, whisk in the flour. Finally add aquafaba, one tablespoon at a\u00a0time. Whisk well after each portion of aquafaba.",
						"3. Gently fold in ground pistachios with a spatula. If prefer less sweet desserts, try adding a bit of matcha powder to the batter, it will contrast the sweetness nicely. You should end up with a very sticky and thick batter.",
						"4. Divide the batter between pastry cases \u2013 use a silicon spatula or clean fingers to tap the filling into the cases snugly. Place half a strawberry on top of each filling \u2013 don\u2019t worry about it sticking above the level of the filling \u2013 the filling will rise during baking a bit and be snug around the strawberry. If you have large strawberries though, you can chop the bottom of the halves off to make them a little less tall.",
						"5. Bake the tarts for about 20-22 minutes, until the filling is just a touch browned around the rim. Remove from the oven and allow the tarts to cool down before removing them from the tins. The tops will crisp up nicely as the tarts cool down."

				"Hi I want to make this especially because of the reviews. My oven isn\u2019t working. Can I cook this on the stove? Thank you",
				"The pulled jackfruit tasted amazing. I\u2019ll definitely be making this again. I used a squeeze of BBQ sauce as I didn\u2019t have liquid smoke.",
				"Where can I find can jack fruit. I have seen it at the farmer\u2019s market but it is the unprocessed fruit. How would I process the raw fruit?",
				"Another fantastic recipe! These were so good that we ate until our stomachs hurt. I chopped the pointy jackfruit ends finely before including them, and added a wee bit of tomato juice for extra moisture. The recipe was followed exactly, otherwise. I served them with your quick pickled red onions (delicious and so simple), guacamole and shredded red cabbage marinated in lime juice. Sooooo good!",
				"LoveLoved itJust trying out Jackfruit",
				"Wow this is DELICIOUS!!! Im a 1st time jackfruit-er and I think I got lucky  in choosing a fruit AND this recipe!  I read through some many and this seemed to be the perfect balance of  layered flavors and not too complicated .  It's a winner for sure!  Thank you!",
				"Thank you! I'm a pretty average cook and this seems easy enough to follow. I'm trying it tonight. Wondering, is it possible to create the tacos and freeze them? Thinking ahead for next time and dinner prep. Ta",
				"I absolutely enjoyed preparing this recipe! 3 years ago my good friend introduced me to pulled jackfruit tacos and we really had a blast! We've recently discovered a shop in Paris where we found jackfruit in a can for a very decent price. Coming at the recommendations of  my friend, I got to discover a little lazycatkitchen. I admit I've skipped the step of leaving the preparartion in the fridge overnight, no smoked liquid, avocado instead of pickled onignions and honey instead marple syrup. Little adjustment but we were crazy in love with this recipe! Thank you, Ania!Next week we're inviting friends over dinner as we kind of need to show off with this dish\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude01",
				"Wow, great recipe ! I followed every step of your process and it worked. The taste is just right! Incredible experience for me! I can become a vegetarian now !Thanks a lot for you good work. You are a pro!",
				"I've only  been able to find frozen jackfruit, I was so  excited to find it.  I have been wanting to try jackfruit tacos for a while.  Do you think that will work?",
				"This is a great recipe and I\u2019ve made it a few times, cooking it on low in a slow cooker over the course of the day instead of refrigerating overnight. Today I tried it with liquid smoke for the first time and I think two teaspoons full is just far too much. How has everyone else gone with this much liquid smoke added? I think I will  stick to just smoked paprika from now on. Cheers for the delicious recipes."

			"time": "75 min",
			"serving": "serves 6-8",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Rinse your chickpeas after an overnight soak and put them into a large pot with plenty of fresh water. Bring them to the boil and simmer for about 75 minutes, until very tender and almost falling apart.",
				"2. Once cooked, fish the chickpeas out of the pot with a slotted spoon and rinse them under a stream of cold water to help loosen the skin. Let the chickpea cooking water cool down completely (it\u2019s best to refrigerate it for a few hours prior to using if you don\u2019t need to make hummus straight away).",
				"3. OPTIONAL STEP: Now, it\u2019s time to peel the chickpeas \u2013 you can skip this step at your own peril. It is worth it though as it only took me 20 minutes to peel them and you get a much smoother hummus if you get rid of the skin. To peel them, simply rub them between your hands and then slip the skin off gently with your fingers. Once peeled, let the chickpeas cool down completely.",
				"4. Use an upright blender. In my experience, it will give your hummus a smoother texture than a food processor. Divide your chickpeas into two batches. Put \u00bd cup of fridge-cold liquid (water or aquafaba) into the blender, half of your chickpeas, roasted red peppers, tahini and lemon juice. Put the lid on and start trickling cold liquid in slowly while the mixture is blending. Once your first batch is smooth and a little on the runny side, add in the remaining chickpeas and blend them in, trickling in more liquid as needed. In order to help the motor work the thick mixture, make small circles with the tip of your spatula (in the direction of the turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture (do not dip the spatula deeper than literally a few millimetres or else you will damage the blades). This will help to burst an air pocket under the surface and helps the motor to turn.",
				"5. Season with salt, garlic, paprika, chilli and blend again until smooth and well seasoned throughout.",
				"6. Serve with a drizzle of chilli oil (if using), toasted bread or pita bread, olives, pickles and anything that takes your fancy. Store in an airtight container in the fridge, it keeps for about 3-4 days."

				"150 ml / \u00bd cup + 2 tbsp full fat coconut milk",
				"60 ml / \u00bc cup maple syrup",
				"1-2 tsp instant coffee (or a generous pinch of fine sea salt) to reinforce the chocolate flavour",
				"180 ml / \u00be cup all natural smooth hazelnut butter (I make my own)",
				"150 g / 1 cup roasted hazelnuts",
				"a few drops of hazelnut extract or vanilla extract (optional)"
			],
			"time": "15 min",
			"serving": "makes 20 truffles",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Chop your chocolate roughly \u2013 I tend to whack an unopened packet against my workbench to break it up. Place the broken-up chocolate in a glass bowl over a water bath and melt very slowly (I use setting 1 out of 6). Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat, but keep the bowl over the hot water.",
				"2. As the chocolate is melting, place the coconut milk in a small pot and warm it up a little bit. Dissolve the instant coffee in the warmed-up milk. I went for 2 tsp of instant coffee to get a hint of coffee in the truffles. If you don\u2019t want to taste coffee, go for 1 tsp instead \u2013 this will simply bring out the chocolate flavour more.",
				"3. Slowly add warm coconut milk to the melted chocolate. If it seizes (chocolate becomes grainy and hard), don\u2019t worry, it happens sometimes but as we are essentially making a ganache here, that\u2019s no problem. Just keep on adding milk and whisking at the same time. At some point the chocolate will return to its glossy and runny state.",
				"4. Whisk in the maple syrup and finally the hazelnut butter. If you happen to have hazelnut (or vanilla extract), add a few drops (you could use both!), but I also made a batch without them and, while they deepen the flavour, they are totally optional.",
				"5. Let the mixture come to room temperature and place in the fridge overnight for it to harden.",
				"6. Before taking the mixture out of the fridge, put aside at least 20 (22 to be safe) hazelnuts and chop the rest quite finely. Spread the chopped hazelnuts on a tray or clean baking sheet.",
				"7. Scoop portions of the mixture. Use kitchen scales to measure out equal sized portions of the mixture first or just eyeball the portions if you don\u2019t have kitchen scales. Flatten each portion in the palm of your hand, place a hazelnut in the middle and then close the truffle mixture around the hazelnut. Quickly roll between the palms of your hands (that\u2019s one area where permanently cold hands help a lot) and then coat the truffle in the chopped hazelnuts. I recommend working in small batches as the mixture will get messier to work with the longer it sits around. Transfer \u00bc of the mixture to a chilled bowl and place the rest of the mixture in the freezer while you roll the first 5 truffles. Proceed in the same way with the remaining \u00be of the mixture.",
				"8. Store in an air-tight container, in the fridge. These truffles should keep for 5-7 days."

				"When you say coconut milk, do you mean the stuff in tins or the stuff in cartons meant as a dairy milk substitute?",
				"Just made them. The mixture behaved really well, and I managed to home make the peanut butter too, however the taste of the dark chocolate is so pronounced that you can't feel the peanut in the middle taste almost at all. I used dark chocolate with 74% cocoa, and only 1 tsp of coffee in the mixture, the marple syrup I used was A grade. Did yours also had this pronounced taste? Next time I am thinking to maybe try it with milk chocolate, to avoid the dark chocolate too pronounced taste.",

				"These were INCREDIBLE! Made a huge batch. You were right, they were pretty messy to make & making hazelnut butter for the 1st time was 'interesting' (never made it to the oily, runny stage...lost patience!). But they look perfect and they taste...OMG! Ania you are in our kitchen every week, making life tastier \ud83e\udd17",
				"These were so so good! (Even though my homemade nut butter didn't turn out so well!) Your blog is amazing. I am loving these recipes. It's so nice to find gourmet vegan recipes that don't have obscure ingredients and that are easy!! Thank you for what you do!",
				"I tried to do it in my VonShef and it's just not cut out for chopping nuts. I just need a food processor!",
				"What adorable little balls of perfection!! These look amazing!",
				"Ferrero Rochers are my weakness when it comes to candy, you can never have to many!  Kudos to you for making them a little bit healthier so I don't feel as guilty :)",

Other recipes were full of huge superfluous amounts of oil, or were not as flavorful (love how the simmer of the tomato sauce brings out the best of the jammy tomato and onion), and yours was the first I found that added cinnamon. So very delicious! Thank you.",
				"I'm going to try these as soon as I can get to a supermarket. I usually eat ready made ones from a can or when I'm on a Greek island.",
				"Hi thereThis recipe looks delicious. Do you shell the beans before cooking them or do the shell come off during the cooking process?",
				"Hi... can't  wait to make these.  I am vegan and adored the Plaki all over Greece this summer.  I cam home and tried to reproduce the dish using giant lima neans but the texture was all wrong.  I have found gignes on amazon and just ordered a 5 pound bag.  Your rexipe will be the one i use!  Thanks for sharing!",
				"Help!  Smells wonderful, sauce is wonderful, but the beans have been in the  oven now for 2 1/2  hours. I have added  a total of 4 more cups of water and they are still crunchy!  I soaked them overnight in a covered pot, then dumped that water, rinsed the benas, put fresh water to cover them by a couple of inches, and simmered them for a full HOUR.  They were somewhat crunchy, but I figured maybe that was what you meant by \u201cal dente\u201d, so I proceeded as the recipe directed.  After the first hour in the oven, uncovered, I added hot water and covered them, hoping that would help.  There was a slight improvement, so I have done that now for a total of four additional cups, gping on the third hour, covered.  The water is being absorbed even with the lid on... I keep checking and that is why I add more.   I am uisng a Le Creuset dutch oven at 355F.  Thoughts?  It smells really good...Thanks!",
				"Had been searching for this style dish to use my Rancho Gordo corona beans,this looks exactly what I need.Do you cover the dish while it bakes in oven?Thank you,(another) Anita",
				"This recipe looks delicious. What would you recommend as a side dish?  Is this something you could pair with quinoa? My companion is slightly picky and is the type that can't eat things like just plain pasta with red sauce or just lentils.  I can't  wait to make this.",
				"Will this recipe work okay with the smaller Lima beans as well?  Would I have to adjust liquid at all?",
				"Wonderful recipe.I like this  and I think this is very delicious.I am going to make this recipe for my family and husband Thanks for sharing",
				"Hi. Can I use tinned butter beans to cut out the over night soaking and if so how much would I need.? ThanksRichard",
				"Hello thank you for your recipe, can I use canned beans and if so how much?",
				"Oooh. I get sooo excited when your recipes come through. Please can you explain what giant beans are xx",
				"Fab. Thank you xx\ud83d\ude09"

				"What's not to love about a recipe where you throw everything in a bowl and mix? One of the simplest hot cross bun recipes I've ever made. I've made this recipe every Good Friday for the last few years. Like all doughs, it gives you time to potter between rises and bakes really quickly. By the afternoon you have the smell of spices and baked treats permeating your home. Still fresh days later, if they last that long. Would recommend and super easy for beginners.",
				"Hi, I only have active dry yeast, how much would I use instead of instant yeast in this recipe?",
				"These hot cross buns look fantastic! My husband is from England and my daughter and I want to make these for Easter. I don\u2019t have any bread flour and can\u2019t get any at this time because all the stores are out of it. Can I use 4 cups all purpose for the whole recipe?  Would they still turn out? Thanks!! Happy Easter",
				"Surely it's mixed spice, not allspice? Just confirming before I get started!",
				"Will this work with coconut sugar!? \u263a\ufe0f",
				"I've never had hot cross buns and have always wanted to make them.  Well, I just made these, and they came out fantastic!  I just love the glaze on top.  What a winner of a recipe \ud83d\ude03",
				"I made these for Good Friday yesterday and they were perfect. My only changes were to use whole wheat flour, date sugar, and rapid rise yeast (because I'm impatient/ don't plan ahead), and to add 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and cloves. I did have to add a bit more liquid, presumably due to the date sugar.",
				"Being a new transplant to the UK, hotcross buns was a new food item to me. To my Brit husband, step son and extended family, this was a beloved treat. As such, I just had to find a vegan recipe that would appeal to these bun lovers. This recipe did it! Easy to follow and produce, two things I love, but all useless without...taste. The boys loved them as did other hotcross bun lovers in my little village. A perfect amount of sweet, but  not overly so, fluffy, and oh so gloriously pretty and presentable once glazed. I highly recommend this recipe.",
				"Great recipe! I made a couple changes: orange juice in place of orange zest, and omitted the oil to make them fat free. I would also suggest to anyone making this (especially if the flour is measured by cup instead of weight) that you do not put in all the flour at the beginning. Leave one cup to add gradually while kneading, as it turned out I did not need the last 1/2 cup at all. A friend who tried the recipe as written had a more dry result. I will make these again!",
				"Made these again this year! They're cooking now. Thank you!",
				"Hi Ania, thank you for the recipe. They turned out exceptionally! No sugar, double amount of homemade apple sauce, spelt flour instead of all purpose, less sultanas... so delectable! And almost gone! :-) I should also mention that I\u2019ve never eaten hot cross buns before, neither store-bought nor homemade! Haha! Happy Easter from Down Under!",
				"I made these last year and loved them!! Last year, however, I had more time to dedicate to baking. Is there a maximum time we should allow for proving? i.e. could I leave the dough to rise in the fridge or on the counter overnight, and then bake them in the morning? If so, would you recommend fridge or counter? Hoping to make these for Good Friday. Thanks in advance!",
				"Cool but when I hit your link and scroll down to the Important Information section and look at the ingredients- it says this (I copied and pasted)Apples, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Water, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).Thats why I was surprised you'd suggest this brand.   Other than that I understand!  Convenience is fab!",
				"Hi ho! Love these so much THANK YOU for all your delicious recipes, I often recommend your page to guests and pupils but have meant to say in the past why buy the Applesauce (I note the one you link to has HFCS in it..really NOT healthy!)  and Applesauce is so so soo easy to make!  Maybe you could amend and link to a homemade applesauce <3  (Just a suggestion) Thanks again!   (I have just shared with a pupil who wanted a good recipe for her newly vegan sister <3 )",
				"I am craving hot cross buns now I've seen this recipe, but want to know if these would work out ok if I used gluten free bread flour and just didn't knead the dough, due to no gluten. I am tempted just to try it and see. Has anyone already had a go at this? If so how do they turn out?",
				"Will these turn out OK without the raisins? My family will not try them if they have raisins ....",
				"Thank you so much!!",
				"Just made a batch. Excellent. Used raspberry jam for glaze as it was all I had to hand. Also microwaved jam/ water mix in small bowl, think this is an easy way to go, worked a treat.Thanks.",
				"I just made these, they are phenomenal! I am sure I will make these many more times. Hi from New Zealand.",
				"Hey thanks for the great recipe, I don't understand the timing though.It says preparation time 20 minutes yet it needs to sit for like 2 hours. Currently making them and this is taking a lot longer than initially anticipated. Beginner at baking.",
				"Oh how pretty! To tell the truth I never tasted  Hot Cross buns in my pre-vegan days. So yours will be my first. I was wondering what is blooming on the hillsides in Greece right now and your little bouquet answered a few questions.  The mallow is just charming. There is a wonderful  soup that the beduin used to feed us made  from fresh foraged mallow leaves and dried goat cheese. Enjoy your Easter  -Hanne"

				"2. Pour in the lukewarm (not cold!) water and stir everything together with a wooden spoon. Then add the  oil and combine.",
				"3. When the mixture has mostly stuck together turn the mixture out on to a work surface. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. Reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Repeat this for 10 minutes. See this recipe for photos on how to knead if you\u2019re unsure.",
				"4. When the dough is shiny and smooth, put it in a large mixing bowl, coat in a thin layer of oil and cover the bowl with a tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm \u2013 ie not next to an open fire!) for between one and two hours (until it has doubled in size).",
				"5. Empty the dough out on to a work surface and push the air out with your fingertips.",
				"6. Split the dough into twelve equal parts \u2013 best to use kitchen scales here.",
				"7. Shape the dough into the classic bagel shape of a circle with a hole in the middle in one of two ways:",
				"8. METHOD 1 \u2013 Roll the dough into a \u201csnake\u201d approximately 18 cm / 7 inches long, loop into a circle and join it with itself (using a bit of water to seal the join). This gives you a nice round bagel with a larger hole but it can potentially come apart in the future poaching step.",
				"9. METHOD 2 \u2013 Form the dough into a circle (like a flattened bread roll) and poke a hole through the middle with your thumb. This usually gives you a slightly \u201cfatter\u201d bagel with a smaller hole, but is highly unlikely to break apart in the future poaching step.",
				"10. Leave to prove, covered on a lightly oiled baking sheet.",
				"11. Pre-heat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F, put a large saucepan (largest diameter possible) of water (at least 10 cm / 4 \u201d depth) to boil, and lightly oil a couple of baking sheets.",
				"12. When the bagels are about 50% bigger or have proved for around 30 minutes, they are ready for the poaching step. Note that I usually 2nd prove bread for twice as long as this, but I do a half proving time with bagels as I find the poaching step expands them too much if I give them a full prove.",
				"13. Turn the boiling water down to a simmer, add \u00bd tsp of baking soda to it and place as many bagels as comfortably fit in the saucepan for 90 seconds on one side, then turn them over and do them for 90 seconds on the other side before removing them from the water. You can do 1 minute on each side for \u201cbreadier\u201d bagels, or 2 minutes on each side for chewier bagels. Place them on the paper towel to dry for a few seconds before placing them on the lightly oiled baking trays.",
				"14. Glaze the top of the bagels with oil (this gives them a golden colour) and put them in the oven to bake for 15\u00a0minutes or until golden brown."

Second time I used one huge sweet potato  weighing exactly 600gr plus I only added 4 table spoons of chickpea flour (not 6) and the texture of the burger was great. I ended up with 6 good size burger patties. I was a bit more generous with the seasoning this time and they were absolutely perfect; firm and crispy on the outside with a wonderful flavour. My whole family enjoyed the burgers and they are not vegan.They take a bit of time to make, but you could perhaps make your sweet potatoes in the microwave instead ( it only takes few minutes ) if you wanted to save some time ;).Thank you very much for the great recipe, certainly the best vegan burgers I made so far :)",

It doesn't say  how many millilitres they are, but a tablespoon is quite big.  I checked the description of few measuring spoons that E-bay sells at the moment and they are always either 15ml or 20ml. I can't measure mine accurately, but it looks like it's a 20ml spoon. I guess his would explain why I only needed 4 tbsp. I will keep it in mind next time :)",

				"This was delicious!! I loved the flavors of all the spices matched with the little bit of sweetness from the sugar- I will definitely be making it again!!",
				"Yum. I'm not usually motivated to cook a big breakfast, but this is one dish that I loooove to eat in the morning. I've made your shakshuka about five times now  and it's a family favorite. I add in an extra block of tofu. My kids and I eat it generously scooped over toast. Thanks for sharing it with us.",
				"This was so delicious!! I made it after a hard day at work and it made me feel so much better!",
				"I love your blog very much and I like the idea of having peas and eggplant in shakshuka! I will surely try it.So far, I liked putting fresh spinach just before adding the \"egg\". It's also nice. =)",
				"Had this for tonight\u2019s dinner. I\u2019ve tried a few of your recipes now and you\u2019ve converted me to tofu!",

				"Just fab, thank you..",
				"Found you with the pistachios biscuits. Love them so looked further and i do love all your recipes.  My 3 daughters are vegans so mum and dad have to go along. Now i'm going along for dinner your site is great.  I use lemon zest instead of orange as i prefer the flavour and alternate the almond with chia or flaxseed ground up for adding omega 3,6 and 9 to the diet.",
				"Great minds think alike - I've been craving menemen (kind of similar to shakshuka - it is based on tomatoes, green peppers and chili - and eggs) last weekend and have successfully veganised it by using the VeganEgg and a bit of kala namak - I've made it three times since! Your version looks delicious too! I'll give tofu another go, it hasn't convinced me as a scrambled egg substitute so far.",
				"So I gave soft tofu a try (I don't have silken tofu at the moment) and it blended with the dish/ flavours beautifully and I have to admit that I've been making some variety of a tomato-based egg dish since! Next time I go shopping I'll get plenty of silken tofu. I think the reason why I wasn't convinced before is because I used hard tofu just like other scrambled eggs recipes suggested and you could still clearly taste the tofu (which I don't actually mind, but it wasn't desired) -  but when I made \u017curek a few months ago I used cubed silken tofu as 'eggs' to float around in the pot and the texture was amazingly realistic! Shame it didn't spark an idea in my brain then ;)So many thanks for suggesting silken tofu! That opened up a door of menemens, shakshukas, leek-tomato mixes etc, that has been shut for so long :)As for the VeganEgg - I probably won't buy it again any time soon as it is very expensive (\u00a37 - \u00a38) and the texture is very spongy and... 80% like scrambled eggs. It's fun to see it scramble, the flavour is egg-like but it's just not convincing which is why I decided to give it a go with menemen and it worked pretty well. Also, it doesn't fill you up for too long. So if I can get a very similar result with silken tofu then it's no question! :)",
				"Hi Ania - I'm not vegan or even vegetarian, but trying to eat more plant based foods as my body loves me back when I do. I found you via your Choc mousse - mainly my curiosity for making my own aquafaba - and I've been drooling over your other recipes. Beautifully put together and photographed - I will definitely be adding some to our weekly menu plans.",
				"This looks heavenly. I tried this dish once but I wasn't thrilled with the \"egginess\" of it. Using tofu is a stroke of genius (and I can skip the black salt as I don't need the egg flavor). You always help me get the spices just right, and this combination looks perfect. Thank you, as always!!"

						"1. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt. Add about 120 ml / \u00bd cup of warm (that\u2019s important) water and 1\u00bd tbsp of oil. Once combined roughly with a wooden spoon, start combining the dough with your hands. It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 2-3 tablespoons of water to achieve a dough that is not too dry or not too sticky. Knead it for 10 minutes with your hands until elastic and smooth. Form the dough into a ball and rub a small amount of oil on the dough\u2019s surface to prevent drying. Place in a clean bowl covered with a kitchen towel and place it somewhere warm (but not too warm, sticking it too close to a fireplace is a bad idea, for example) for 1-2 hrs or until it doubles in size.",
						"2. Cut two circles (if you have a two tier bamboo steamer) of baking paper to line the steamer with. Make a lot of small holes in the circles so that the steam can get through. You can use a paper puncher for this or fold each circle in half 3 times and cut small circles out along the folded edges with a pair of scissors. Prepare also eight 5 cm / 2\u2033 squares of baking paper and insert into the buns to prevent the two halves from sticking to each other (you could also use oil instead).",
						"3. After the dough has doubled in size, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and press the air our with your fingertips. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and form small balls. Place the balls on a lightly floured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and leave for another 30 min.",
						"4. Using a rolling pin, roll the balls out into \u00bd cm / \u00bc\u201d thick oval shapes. Fold each shape in half and insert a square of baking paper between the two halves. Alternatively you could also oil the buns before folding in half.",
						"5. Line your bamboo steamer with paper circles you\u2019ve made earlier and place folded up buns inside for another 30 min of proving. If your steamer is too small (like mine), place four buns inside (two on each tier) and rest the remaining four on a baking paper lined and lightly dusted tray until you are ready to steam.",
						"6. Half fill a pot (which the steamer can comfortably sit on, of course) with water and place the steamer with the buns on top. Whack the heat to medium-high (I used setting 4 out of 6) and let the water come to a simmer \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to peak inside or you will ruin the buns. Once you can hear the water simmering vigorously, put the timer on to 10 mins. After the time is up, take the pot and steamer off the heat and rest the buns for another 5 minutes. This will spare the buns temperature shock and will prevent them from shrinking. After 5 minutes, lift the lid off and remove the buns gently. Cook the remaining four like you did the first four."

						"2. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a medium size pan. Fry spring onions until softened. Add chopped garlic and ginger and fry gently until soft and fragrant.",

The instructions for steaming the buns was clear and great- they turned out perfectly. Definitely a fun meal! I ended up using some general tso's sauce that I had to put on top to make this a bit saucier. I topped the jackfruit with ribboned carrots, sliced cucumbers, purple cabbage, and crushed peanuts.

						"1. Place the first 3 ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and very gradually start adding in plant milk (60 ml / \u00bc cup at a time) whisking the whole time. Whisk well after each addition to ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. Initially the batter will look thick and gloopy, but it will start looking like a cr\u00eape batter with every milk addition.",
						"2. In a separate bowl, whisk aquafaba with a hand whisk until frothy and light and add it into the cr\u00eape batter.",
						"3. Finally whisk in maple syrup (if using), melted oil and adjust the amount of plant milk to ensure the batter is the right consistency \u2013 it should be runny, but should coat the back of the spoon.",
						"4. Heat up a medium (I used 24 cm / 9.5 \u201d pan) non-stick pan on a medium heat. Brush the pan with a small amount of oil to make sure that the pancakes do not stick. Take the pan into your hand (off the stove) and pour a thin layer of batter (I found that 60 ml / \u00bc cup of batter is optimal) into the pan and swivel it well to form a thin, round cr\u00eape. Put the pan back on the stove and cook until the crepe no longer sticks to the pan and can be flipped to the other side. Once flipped, cook the cr\u00eape on the other side\u00a0for another minute or so.",
						"5. Put cooked cr\u00eapes in a stack so that they do not dry out and become brittle.",

						"2. Heat up a medium pan. Add a tablespoon of coconut (or olive oil) and once it heats up, throw in diced apple and sprinkle with cinnamon. Stir well to coat.",
						"3. Add a splash of water (or brandy if you like) to the apples and let them cook gently, on a low-medium heat, until they become soft and cooked through. Once ready, they will become less opaque."
					]
				},
				{
					"CARAMEL SAUCE (SUGAR VERSION)": [
						"1. Spread an even layer of sugar at the bottom of a dry pan or pot. Heat up the sugar on a medium heat (I used setting 3 out of 6). Refrain from stirring it, although if your pan has hot spots, you may need to gently manoeuvre the unmelted sugar into a hot spot. Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.",
						"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel, the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in the warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.",
						"3. There is a chance that once you add the coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup / 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove and reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce."
					]
				},
				{
					"CARAMEL SAUCE (HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE)": [
						"1. Slowly heat up maple syrup in a pan. When it starts to boil gently, take it off the heat. Stir in almond butter and salt with a hand whisk. Return the pan to the stove and simmer very gently, stirring the caramel for another minute to thicken the sauce a little bit \u2013 remember that it will thicken a bit more as it cools anyway. If it\u2019s too thick once cool, stir in a few drops of plant milk to bring the desired consistency back. Set aside."

Amazing flavour!!",

				"1. If you are using fresh oranges, wash them very well, place them in a bowl and cover with boiling water for a few seconds to dewax and sterilise them. Take them out and cut them into medium slices. Place orange slices in a medium pot with 1 cup of water and \u00bd cup of sugar. Cover with a lid and simmer on a very low heat (I use setting 1 out of 6) for about 1 hour, until orange slices are soft and semi-transparent. Drain orange slices on a few pieces of kitchen towel so that you don\u2019t add extra moisture to the brownies.",
				"2. Chop or break up the chocolate into smaller pieces with your hands. Place chocolate in a glass bowl over a water bath (bain-marie). Make sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Simmer on a very low heat until the chocolate has melted. Add coconut oil and give the mixture a good stir to combine the two. Take the bowl off the pot and allow the chocolate to cool down.",
				"3. Place almond flour, cornflour / cornstarch, buckwheat flour and baking powder in a small bowl. Mix very well.",
				"4. Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F. Grease a brownie tin (I used a 19 cm / 7.5 \u201d square tin) with a little bit of olive oil.",
				"5. In a clean metal or glass bowl whip aquafaba until you get stiff peaks. It is very important that the bowl has no grease residue as this will prevent the aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks. Once the aquafaba is at the stiff peaks stage (turn the bowl upside down, if aquafaba does not slide down at all, it means that it has reached stiff peaks), start adding sugar very gradually, half a tablespoon at the time, whipping well after each addition.",
				"6. Gradually (and gently so that you don\u2019t knock too much air out of the whipped aquafaba) fold flour and baking powder mixture into whipped aquafaba with a spatula or a spoon.",
				"7. Next, incorporate melted chocolate slowly until you achieve an even looking batter.",
				"8. Chop 6 orange slices (drained of excess moisture) finely and gently fold them into the batter.",
				"9. Spoon the batter into the brownie tin. Decorate with orange slices \u2013 I used 9 halves, leaving generous gaps between them. Do not cover the entire brownie with orange slices as they will prevent the top from getting crispy. You can also bake the brownies without orange slices (for an even crispier top) and add orange slices afterwards, before cutting the brownies.",
				"10. Bake for 30 (they will be \u00fcber gooey like in my photo) or 35 mins (they will be a bit firmer but still fudgy). Remove from the oven and let the brownies cool COMPLETELY before cutting into 9 or 16 pieces. These brownies are rather rich so I recommend 16 smaller pieces."

				"These are fantastic! After reading about the sugar, I opted for coconut sugar, maybe someone could enlighten me about the processing of that?Not fond of 'cookies' with soft centres, these are crunchy to the last crumb!",
				"Thank you for this recipe. I make this regularly for friends and family. I follow the recipe to the t! Thank you!",
				"Whilst I'm not vegan but don't really eat meat anymore, for the pure  vegans that have made and eaten this maybe an alternative to castor sugar would be recommended. I haul sugar cane during the harvest and can guarantee that a lot of animals including wild dogs, pigs and native animals end up in the bin with the cut cane... Food for thought.... Good recipe by the way...",
				"Great recipe and super flexible. I used some left over untoasted muesli I bought for a guest, replacing the oats and coconut and they worked out fine. I did have to add a little extra flour because the muesli was quite dense and didn\u2019t soak up as much liquid. I then discovered a pack of coconut hiding up the back of the cupboard and so made the recipe as written and that also worked well - although the different batches have slightly different textures as you\u2019d expect. Now the only problem is what to do with all these biscuits!",
				"Just made the Anzac biscuits which are now my favorite cookie.  I did not have coconut, so I used an equal amount of almond flour.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, using the maple syrup choice. Easy to make!  Beware of eating all of the dough raw (tasty!). The cookies are just the right crunch - not too hard and not too delicate.  Sweet enough but not overly sweet.  Yum, yum, yum - thank you for another wonderful  vegan recipe, Ania.",

				"This is an excellent ANZAC bikkie recipe!  I was missing home this week and they hit the spot. I added some Grape Nuts for extra crunch and malty goodness, but the original recipe is delicious on its own too. Thanks so much for posting!",
				"I was browsing to find a vegan cookie and so pleased I came across this recipe. I used coconut oil instead of vegan butter as I had it on hand and they turned out fab, thank you so much.",
				"These cookies are AMAZING! How can I make them pumpkin flavored? Just add pumpkin? Or replace some butter with pumpkin?",
				"I would just like to say these biscuits are bloody awesome , i also added some dried cranberries from a packet  mmmmmm yom yom will be making more  a staple to our diet lol",
				"Ohhh goodness!!  Absolutely delicious! After reading all the fantastic reviews I decided to half the recipe because I knew the possibility of eating too many would be my reality!  I used brown sugar and quick oats as that\u2019s what was in the cupboard and they turned out amazing! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely be making and sharing this one many times.",

				"These are so delicious! Currently living abroad and these were the perfect cure for my home sickness! Gave a batch to some Aussie neighbours and they were a hit!",
				"Thanks for the recipe, they turned out perfect\ud83d\ude0a I used coconut oil, maple syrup and only 1/4 tspn of bicarbonate Soda after reading previous comments. Will be making these again and again. Thank you",
				"Yum! I just made these using coconut oil and golden syrup. The two didn\u2019t come together in the saucepan but I added it anyway and  was fine once stirred through the dry ingredients. Would make again!",
				"Made these today on ANZAC day, it\u2019s warm here about 28 deg Celsius so I needed a tiny amount water  as suggested. Turned out great, we melted some vegan chocolate  over the top and bam \ud83d\udca5 delicious",
				"Unfortunately my batch were really crumbly and wouldn\u2019t shape into balls either, but pliers on with half the batch then decided to add an egg to the other half as mix wasn\u2019t binding. Defeats the purpose of vegan cookies I guess but didn\u2019t see the suggestion for adding extra hot water to mix until it was too late, maybe add that note into the recipe as I see looking at the comments a lot of people have had the same outcome.",
				"I made these and the dough was falling apart and hard to shape. I figured it might have been because I used large flake oats. I see in the comments now that you wrote that adding hot water might have been helpful to bind them. When baked they were very crumbly but more or less kept their shape - and were very delicious!",
				"Made these a second time. So delicious. Thank you!",
				"I wish all recipes had the measurements in grams... some things are just really annoying to measure out in cups and a kitchen scale is so cheap. Thanks for using grams! :)",
				"WOW! Looks yummy thanks for the recipe good work keep posting like this always love your recipes :)",
				"ARRRR..cups, or any measuring can seem confusing...as like for like is really a brain mush...suddenly I see the light...big thank you...honest without your recipe I would not have got started at all....XX  I have left only two reviews like this in a great many years and do thank you :-))",
				"Hullo With a friend coming over who loves a good munch I had a quick trawl for a quick biscuit recipe.. she's not vegan but trying to be more plant based...many suggestions inc: how not to die has seen many changes in her lifestyle and I am encouraging her with my vegan food/plant based diet.So using what I had at home I have to tell you how amazing these worked out.  I only had spelt flour and my baking soda was dead, so I added baking powder. I also had a mix of vegan Marg and coconut butter...it all worked...I also added 70g of muesli, which I blitzed in a food processor and 15g of spelt to make up for the desiccated coconut ...only other adjustment was 2 extra tablespoons of hot water as the spelt flour need more moisture to enable the dough to be doughy!!!So I really messed with your recipe and guess what they were still brilliant and that is priceless, sometimes I find that internet recipes can be hit and miss ... I was also worried as your recipe says 100g = 1 cup!! So i  ignored the cups and stayed with the 100grams as a cup I think is normally 240grams... Ho HUMThank you again for a great biscuit recipe that worked even tho I tweaked it a awful lot!!!",
				"Hey just wondering what the extra tbsp of caster sugar and Flour are for...as I see it in the ingredient list but it doesn't get mentioned at all in the recipe.",
				"I just made it with coconut oil but it was really crumbly. I measured everything in grams. I added more oil, about 60 g extra, because I couldn\u2019t roll a ball of this original mixture. I baked it in 180 degrees and it was done in 10 minutes. It turned out greasy and crumbled a lot. The taste is goed though.",
				"Made them today and they are the best vegan cookies I've ever tried! As I had some mixture of grinded hazelnuts, I put these instead of coconut and they are amazing.. looking forward though to try also with coconut. Thank you very much for this delightful variation of anzac \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude18",
				"Made lovely cookies but despite following recipe closely the mix was too dry to shape into balls so I added coconut milk. I used solid raw coconut oil not refined - would that be why it was too dry? Everyone enjoyed them and they have only lasted one evening! Highly recommend this delicious and easy recipe to all. :) Also wondered what adding sultanas would be like...",
				"Hi, the recipe looks great, actually tasted awesome in the cooking bowl before I added the baking soda, I tried it after cooking, unfortunately the batch had to be thrown out, the baking soda was really bitter, too overpowering. I believe this recipe you are using is half of the standard dry ingredients, so maybe for this amount of ingredients, it needs to be adjusted to half a teaspoon of baking soda?  I just went to another recipe site and pulled up their ingredients, and its double the dry ingredients to 1 tsp of baking soda.  Just thought id add this comment in here, incase others have a similar experience, maybe best to halve the baking soda for this recipe.Excellent vegan recipe's though,  I would love to try some of your dinners, they look amazing.Jesus bless you :-)))",
				"These Anzacs are amazing! So crunchy and delicious! Best vegan biscuit I've made. Thank you Duncan",
				"For me the cookies came out tasting too strong of baking soda. Next time I might halve the amount. But overall still good!",
				"These turned out so well! I made them gluten free by using GF oats and subbing 1 cup store bought GF blend plus  2 tbsp almond flour. Yummy!",
				"These look so good! I recently made some oaty vegan cookies this past weekend, that i'll soon share on my blog but I LOVE the idea of adding coconut. Can't wait to try! xx ",
				"Love your blog. Thanks for all the great ideas as  I am new at the plant based eating lifestyle. Warms my heart as a Kiwi to see ANZAC biscuits featured. Kind regards Nikki",
				"Hi, how can this recipe by changed to be gluten-free, but still vegan? I suffer from wheat intolerance and I'm very new to GF baking (finding it very challenging)."

Give it a stir half way through the cooking time to make sure all the pieces caramelise at a similar pace.",
						"2. Place a medium pot of water on the stove and let the water come to the boil. Measure / weigh out your pasta.",
						"3. About 20 minutes in, heat up 2-3 tbsp of olive oil in a small pan. Once the oil gets hot, add half of your sage leaves. Coat the leaves in oil and fry them for a few seconds until the sides curl up slightly but before the leaves lose their colour. Fish them out and place on a piece of kitchen towel and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Proceed to fry the remaining leaves in the same way.",

						"5. Transfer the oil you\u2019ve fried sage in into a large frying pan and let it heat up on a low-medium heat. Once hot, add finely diced garlic and chilli (if using). Fry them both off gently, stirring frequently so that they don\u2019t burn.",
						"6. Mash half the butternut squash with a fork. You can also use a food processor or blender for a smoother texture, but I prefer the lazy way in this case both for texture and speed! Put mashed butternut squash into the pan with chilli and garlic and add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen the \u2018sauce\u2019 up a bit.",
						"7. Add drained pasta and butternut squash cubes into the pan. Toss well. Taste and season with salt and pepper, a squeeze of lemon juice and additional chilli if needed.",
						"8. Serve immediately with toasted pine nuts, crushed fried sage leaves and coconut bacon on top."

Put buckwheat into a small pot with a glass lid and add 3 cups / 720 ml of water, cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Do not salt it until it\u2019s been cooked as salt negatively affects buckwheat\u2019s texture. Once the water comes to the boil, turn the heat down to low and cook on a low heat until all the water has been absorbed (to check, tip the pot to see if water is coming out from underneath the buckwheat, but DO NOT LIFT THE LID). Once the water has been fully absorbed, rest the pot for another 10 minutes (with the lid firmly on) so that the buckwheat finishes cooking in its own steam.",

I used no oil, added two leeks, extra garlic, added about 6 -8 cups of large kale and collard greens instead of spinach, extra garlic, 6 beets that were already cooked but I warmed with the rosemary salt and balsamic vinegar and a little less Kasha. Served with a side of asparagus made a perfect match. Hope your not offended by my changes. We had it as a main course and truly loved it. I have already picked out several more of your recipes to try \ud83d\ude00. Thanks again for your hard work testing and blogging.",

It was delicious though spinach would have been the cherry on the cake \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02Since asparagus season is coming up I\u2019ll probably cook it again using buckwheat and adding green asparagus. In general I would change the ratio of grains vs veggies a bit, maybe even doubling the amount of veg or at least the amount of leeks.Thanks for the recipe, it\u2019s a keeper! Also the rosemary beetroot on it\u2019s own is something I\u2019ll likely cook again.

						"2. Heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
						"3. Peel the beetroots. Pound 3 tsp of dry rosemary with 1\u00bd tsp of coarse sea salt in a pestle and mortar until you get fine rosemary salt. Brush the beetroots with olive oil and sprinkle with some (not all) of the rosemary salt. Place on a baking tray and put into the hot oven for about 1 hour (until the beetroots can be easily pierced with a knife).",
						"4. Place balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small pot. Bring it to the boil gently and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes or so until the liquid reduces by about \u00bd and becomes thick. Beware that it will become even thicker once it cools so don\u2019t let it reduce too much. If you do, add a splash of water to bring it back.",
						"5. Heat up 3 tbsp of olive oil in a heavy base pan. Add finely chopped shallots to a hot oil (you want them to sizzle once added to the pan). Fry on a low heat stirring from time to time, until lightly browned. Add garlic and fry it off for a few minutes until soft and fragrant. Chop your mushrooms into a fine dice (you can also use a food processor) while you\u2019re frying the shallots and garlic.",
						"6. Now, remove one third of the shallot and garlic mixture and set aside. Add chopped up mushrooms into the pan and coat in the shallot and garlic mixture. Cook mushrooms on a medium heat until all the water evaporates.",
						"7. Add wine to the pan and allow it to cook out. Season the mushroom mixture with some of the rosemary salt and black pepper. Let it cool. Once cool, add chia egg and mix well. The mixture should be sticky but not watery.",
						"8. Wilt spinach in a warmed-up pan with a lid.  Once wilted, allow it to cool completely. Once cool squeeze all the water out of the spinach using your hands or a muslin cloth. Go over the spinach twice or even three times to ensure that it is as dry as possible. Place spinach in a large bowl, season with rosemary salt, pepper and nutritional yeast. Add shallot and garlic mixture you\u2019ve set aside in step 6, \u00bc cup of breadcrumbs and fold in toasted walnuts."
					]
				},
				{
					"ASSEMBLY": [
						"1. Line a baking tray with a fresh sheet of baking paper and heat up the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F.",
						"2. Flour the baking paper very lightly and place a defrosted sheet of puff pastry on it so that the shorter pastry edge is facing you.",
						"3. Designate a long, narrow (about 10 cm / 4 in by 25 cm / 10 in) area where the filing mixture will be stacked. Place it about 5 cm / 2 in from the edge of the pastry so that the pastry on the other side of the filling is long enough to be folded over the filling. Leave 5 cm / 2 in  margin at the ends too so that you are able to fold the ends nicely. Scatter a bit of extra breadcrumbs on the pastry, under the filling to prevent a soggy bottom. Start the stack by making a long rectangle with the spinach mixture. Press it down well with your hands so that it is tightly packed. Place four roasted beetroots in a long row over the spinach. For more stability, you may want to skewer all the beetroots together with a long wooden skewer, which you can pull out after cutting into the Wellington. Now mould the mushroom mixture over the beetroots making sure it fills all the nooks and crannies tightly. Finally, fold the pastry over the filling as tightly as you can \u2013 it\u2019s good to have another pair of hands here to make sure the pastry is tightly wrapped around the filling. Seal it together with the 5 cm / 2 in margin you left on the other side. If there is too much overlap, trim the excess. Wrap the pastry at both ends like you would wrap a present. Make shallow cuts on the top of the Wellington with a sharp knife. Brush soy milk and aquafaba \u2018egg wash\u2019 all over the Wellington and sprinkle the top with your garnish of choice \u2013 I used black salt. Make three small holes in the pastry (on the side where the seam is) to ensure steam can escape during baking and the pastry does not burst. Bake for about 60 minutes, until golden.",
						"4. Serve with your favourite side dishes drizzled with the balsamic reduction you made earlier."

				"I made this for xmas this year and it was amazing! Thanks so much! https://howgrow.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/my-very-first-veggie-christmas/",
				"I am planning on making this for Christmas day this year but I am having to make it a day or two beforehand to reheat on the big day. I am just wondering though if it might be suitable for freezing? In which case i could make it at a more convenient time . Thank you",
				"Made this last night,  amazing, so tasty and not difficult as long as you're organised. Will definitely make it again.Thank you",
				"I'm going away at christmas and as the only vegan wanted to prepare myself, this recipe looks gorgeous! I just wanted to know is it possible to freeze at the stage when the recipe is ready to go in the oven, and then thaw it and cook on christmas?",
				"Hi there!I' m super excited to finally try this recipe but I have a question about the puff pastry. What size was your full sheet of pastry?  The pastry I was able to get here comes in a block that can be separated in two and needs to be rolled out by hand. Each block yields a 12x12 inch square of pastry. From reading the recipe I get that one side needs to be about 14 inches, but I'm not sure about the other side.Thanks so much!",
				"Can this be made a day or two ahead of time, refrigerated, and baked later?",
				"I want to start by saying, I am a novice how me cook. The directions were clear and easy to follow. I was shocked at how beautiful it turned out. I made this for Thanksgiving and, a month later, my friends and family are still raving about it. I left out the nuts for allergy reasons but  it didn\u2019t seem to affect the final outcome as far as I can tell because it was just amazing.",
				"This recipe looks wonderful and I am so excited to serve your Beet Wellington at a dinner party on Saturday.  Can you direct me to the recipe for the cabbage side dish that accompanies it in the photographs?  The two items look scrumptious together.",
				"Can this be made in advance and frozen?Thanks!",
				"This looks amazing. I have beets that need to get used this week so i will be making this for Thanksgiving. My question though, any type of mushrooms okay to use in this recipe? i have baby bella mushrooms. Also, i have unsweetened almond milk and flax seed milk, that okay to use as well or does it need to be soy? White wine? Any vegan friendly wine recommendation? Thank you.",
				"Can it be made ahead of time?  I would love to take it to my book club Christmas pot luck.",
				"Is there anything I can use instead of mushrooms?? I'm really not a fan",
				"My number one!Didn\u2019t use yeast and added more breadcrumbs Wrapped it tightly in clingfilm and let it rest for 10 minutes in the fridge before baking. Came out delicious",
				"This looks absolutely gorgeous!!",
				"I made this, but as am not vegan added butter to the mushroom mix, used a normal egg and normal pastry.  A really fantastic recipe - will definitely be making again in the future, thank you for sharing! Everyone really loved it!",
				"Clever recipe for vegans...thanks!",
				"Wow, this looks incredible! It's literally making my mouth water, lol. I am pinning this recipe for sure for fall and winter gatherings!",
				"Hi Ania, My carnivorous twin brother decided to make beef Wellington for Christmas this year, so I was very pleased to use your recipe for my vegan alternative! Not only did it have everyone chuckling, but my entire meat/eating family agreed that it was delicious. Thank you!",
				"Hi, Ania! This looks fabulous. Quick question for you. In step 6, you direct us to remove a third of the cooked shallots, but don't mention hat portion again. Are we meant to mix it into the cooked spinach? Thanks for clarifying. And thanks for sharing this beautiful dish!",
				"I made this for Christmas dinner and it came out looking beautiful and got good reviews from the vegans and vegetarians at the meal. The reduced balsamic vinegar sauce was delicious. I forget to use the nutritional yeast and, though  I taasted the walnuts, I forgot to put them in the spinach also. That crunch element was missed in the dish. I also didn't have black salt or poppy seeds so I just sprinkled black pepper over it and it looked fine. But when I make it again this is what I will do. I will use less mushrooms and more  spinach. (I had leftover mushroom-mixture  after stacking it on the beets.) I will role out the dough to be wider to easily cover the log. I think I will slice up the beets rather than leave them whole. It was hard to cut the log without making a mess of it. I think if you slice the beets and use the skewer to hold them together it will work better. Also, I was thinking it may be interesting to use vegan sausages instead of the beets for an entirely different take. Or  maybe make a loaf out of the  delicious \"Beyond Meat\" hamburgers and cover that with the spinach and mushroom mixture.  But then the impact of that beautiful red beet will be lost. Maybe wrapping  smaller beets in the \"meat\" loaf will do it---or--- am I getting crazy here.",
				"This is stunning.  I'm making it for Christmas but am a little confused (and nervous) about how to wrap it right.  Pepperige farm PP sheets are 10x15\", so I want to fill 4x10.  In order to have seams on the short ends  I would need to run the 4x10 square right up to the edges.  Any advise would be very much apprecated.  Thanks for this incrediblely beautiful masterpiece.  Just brilliant!",
				"Thank you, Ania.  How kind of you to reply so quickly.  I've created a diagram and am feeling much better about it.  Unless it's a complete failure, I'll upload photos.  I just can't even believe I get to make this!!! Thanks again and Happy Holidays!Kate",
				"Hey :) Is it possible to cut the beets and Mix with the other stuff?",
				"Hi Ania, this looks great! Unfortunately my boyfriend can't stand mushrooms. Can you suggest any alternatives for this recipe? Thanks! Lesley",
				"Thanks, Ania, really like your suggested alternatives!",
				"is it \u00bc cup nutritional yeast absolutely necessary? How can I replace it?",
				"Ania Thanks! I will try do it for this Christmas :) BTW: Love your blog :)"

			"time": "10 min",

			"recipe": [
				"1. Place coconut oil in a small pot and melt it on the lowest setting. Let it cool down a little bit.",
				"2. Sift the flour into a medium size bowl. Add baking soda, all the spices and salt. Mix really well.",
				"3. Place melted coconut oil, dark brown sugar and reduced aquafaba in a large bowl. Cream them together with an electric whisk until well combined and slightly thickened. Add maple syrup and whisk some more until you get a homogeneous mixture.",
				"4. Fold 1/3 of the flour mix into the wet ingredients and, once combined, add the remaining two thirds, one by one. Make sure there are no flour pockets and everything is well combined but do not knead. The dough will be quite loose and sticky, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s the way it should be. Divide the dough roughly into 2 portions and wrap each in a piece of cling film (glad wrap). Place them in the fridge for at least 1 hour. You can safely keep it in the fridge overnight too.",
				"5. Before you are about to take the dough out of the fridge, set the oven to 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F and line two baking trays with a piece of baking paper.",
				"6. After resting, take the first portion of the dough out of the fridge. Give it a few minutes to bring it to room temperature. Roll it out (gently pressing with a rolling pin) on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out quite thick (about 5 mm / 0.2 inch) and cut the cookies out of it with cookie cutters. If you want the cookies to be crunchy, roll them out a bit thinner and bake them for longer.",
				"7. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking trays. You don\u2019t need to leave a lot of space between them as they don\u2019t expand much. Group similar size cookies together so that they cook in the same time. Bake small cookies for about 7-9 minutes and larger for 10-12 minutes. The longer you bake them for the crispier (and less soft and chewy) they will turn out so adjust baking time to your preference.",
				"8. To make the icing, mix icing sugar with a very small amount of water (added very gradually) until you obtain a thick sugar paste. I used beetroot juice (squeezed with my hand from 1 coarsely grated beetroot) instead of water to make pink icing and a touch of matcha powder (and water) to make green icing. If you want to do that divide the icing sugar between 3 bowls and treat each portion accordingly.",
				"9. Place your icing into a small plastic or pastry bag. Push it all into one corner and cut a tiny bit off that corner with a pair of scissors. Start with a small hole and make it bigger if necessary. Apply the icing by squeezing the icing through the hole."

I used golden syrup instead as it\u2019s all I had and it was delicious. The aquafaba was new to me but worked well. I halved the recipe but now wish I made more!! When I heated the oil after I took it off the heat, I added the sugar then a stick of cinnamon, some fresh cloves and cardomam as well. Let it infused then removed it. Also I put nutmeg too Will definitely be using again - thanks for posting :)",

				"Hey Ania! Love your version of gingerbread cookies, and there is nothing wrong with your icing skills! They look awesome! Also, congratulations to your parents for coming up with the idea of plasticine to keep you guys occupied! My parents used to give me and my brothers packs of 'wycinanki'  and got us to make all the paper chains for xmas tree , then whoever made the longest one, won (there were no prizes, as you said, communist/ post communist Poland  sucked! :)  pinning these bad boys for later! x",

A painfully slow way to make fried potatoes, but very good! Deep frying would be easier. The baking seems necessary to make the spices blend? I also added some powdered garlic to the potatoes. The dipping sauce is worth making as well. When you soak cashews all night, the juice is a very tasty nut milk. I'll definitely be making this again. Thank you!",

Brush the flesh with a bit of olive oil and bake for about 40 mins, until caramelised and soft. Turn the the pieces over halfway through the baking time.

I used red miso instead of white, 2 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves, sesame oil instead of olive oil, 1 red onion instead of shallots, and red kuri squash as the pumpkin. I would definitely make again with whatever I have on hand next time :)",

Trim ends off as they tend to be dry and therefore brittle and divide the entire roll into as many 6.5 cm / 2.5 in wide segments as you can.

				"These are so delicious! I didn't have enough fresh spinach so substituted for the same weight of frozen. It looked like a lot to begin with but once blended with the other ingredients was beautifully balanced. I didn't have time to reduce the aquafaba so used melted nuttelex which worked well. Your vegan ricotta recipe worked so well in them too. They were a little fiddly but well worth the effort :)",

Phylo dough is so tricky, every time I do something with it I swear it's the last time, but here I'm again. There's just something about that flaky crispy goodness!

						"3. Add vanilla seeds and season with lime or lemon juice to taste. If using a blender that isn\u2019t as powerful as a Vitamix or a Blendtec, make small circles on the surface of the mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula. Don\u2019t dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. This simple trick will help your blender process the heavy mixture by preventing air pockets from forming under the mixture\u2019s surface.",

Make sure you simmer the mixture (stirring frequently) for about 10-15 minutes until the flakes almost dissolve or otherwise the agar will not work.

It\u2019s done when a toothpick comes out fairly clean. Once the first cake finishes baking, place the second one in the oven and bake for the same amount of time. I don\u2019t recommend baking both cakes at once as you may end up with uneven results. If using a single springform tin, let the first cake cool down, remove it gently from the tin, clean the tin, grease it and fill with the second half of the batter. Bake for approx. 45 min or until a toothpick comes out fairly clean."

As for the salt, I probably won't reduce it much, as I think potatoes need the salt  for flavor, but  how would this turn out if I skipped the oil?  Is there a  doable substitution for the oil?   If this recipe really can't be  changed enough, I will still make it - just will have to wait for a special occasion like Thanksgiving.  Thank you!",

				"Delicious! This is the kind of curry I can get excited about. I substituted lime leaves for curry leaves because that's what we had and left the fenugreek out because we didn't have any. It turned out really well. Thank you.",
				"So amazing and delicious! I don't have any indian markets near me so didn't use curry leaves or fenugreek seeds. I added lime and lime zest instead (idk, some website said that was a good sub for curry leaves haha). Even w/o following it to a T, the recipe was incredible and a really amazing jumping off point for any vegetables I have lying around!!! Thank you so much :) (Also, I served it to a passionate non-vegan who went back for thirds). (and the toasted cashews are a MUST)",

I added baked triangles of firm tofu, too, which went really well.Hope the kitten is a big fat cat snoozing in a forever home these days!

When actually making the soup do you use all the Khao Soi paste that we prepared or is it only a portion of that? Just wanna make sure that if I\u2019m only supposed to use a portion I don\u2019t use it all and mess up my soup LOL! Thanks in advance!!",
				"Hi from Germany :) this was so delicious!!! I was looking for a veggie version of my favourite  Chiang Mai street market dish and I finally found it - so happy! Thanks for the receipe! I added  some black Cardamom seeds. So so sooooooo good - I\u2018m still doing a happy dance while my boyfriend is cleaning the kitchen :)",

I think it would work with pretty much any vegetable as well, I used potato, zucchini, carrot and sauteed some mushrooms in soy sauce to put on top and it's probably the best thing I've eaten in ages. In fact I may just make some of the special paste and bottle it up to give to my family so everyone can experience Ania's genius. Thank you so much! Love from NZ",

				"First, this soup looks AMAZING. I can't wait to try it, so thank you for another wonderful recipe. Second, thank you for saving the kitten. I, too, faced a similar situation a few months ago--minus the speeding car and the fleas. I found a half-starved, tiny kitten in the road, trying to catch a bug. Like your cat, my two rescue boys hated her on sight and refused to enter the house while she was in it. I've had her two months now, and I  hate to tell you this, Ania, but now that she's a little bigger, the boys don't run anymore, and she wraps her little paws around one as they sleep together. Granted, female cats are notorious for not accepting new females into their domain, but once the little one is healthy and growing, Tina might find she likes having a companion. Just saying  . . .  In the meantime, she is a very luck y girl that you two found her and are caring for her.",
				"Ania you are encouraging my obsession with squash and pumpkin. The photos on this one are particularly  enticing with the repeating points of earthy orange,  fiery red and brilliant green.  Why don't you contact HydraArk about the new kitten. They are super friendly and helpful. If you make up a little  bio for the kitten replete with photos many of us would share it on Facebook  .-Johanne",
				"Love this recipe! Will try it soon :) About the kitty, I cannot say enough how happy I ham that you found her and are taking care of her - she is very lucky! I had  a simillar situation a few months ago and I was very fortunate to have found my street kitties a forever home where they are being treated with love! I hope you find a home for your foster kitty soon*"

I have made it several times already with different nuts too (walnuts and peanuts)I buckwheat flour is not available where I live so I use oat flour, I divided the dough into 24 cookies instead of 16 (because more cookies, right?), the result was incredible crispy cookies instead of soft, which is how I actually prefer my cookies :)The first time to make it I felt it was not sweet enough for me, so the following times I eliminated the cocoa powder and increased the amount of flour a bit, it was a huge hit in my house. I plan on experimenting a bit more and try using date paste for sweetening as well.Love it!Yasmeen",

I\u2019d like to try those adding some vegetable oil or so. What do you think? Thanks for uour answer. Can\u2019t rate as I dis not yet try it out.",

				"4. Add a bay leaf, half a chopped onion and thyme infusion and cover with a lid leaving a small gap. Simmer on a low-medium heat until peas are completely mushy and soft \u2013 depending on their size they will take about 45 min / 1 hour. Top up with more water if the water boils out too soon.",

				"6. Add lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Traditionally, Greeks use quite a bit of olive oil in the fava, but I prefer a more healthy version and only added 1 tablespoon \u2013 add more if you prefer it more indulgent and creamier. Blend well. If using an upright blender that isn\u2019t a Vitamix or a Blendtec, you may want to use this tip to achieve a smoother fava: make small circles on the surface of your fava (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula (don\u2019t dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades). This simple trick will prevent air pockets from forming under the mixture\u2019s surface, helping your blender process the heavy mixture. Drizzle in a bit more water if the mixture is too thick \u2013 don\u2019t worry if the fava appears too runny at first as it tends to get thicker when as cools down.",
				"7. Serve warm (recommended) or at room temperature, topped with extra virgin\u00a0olive oil, caramelised red onions, capers and a pinch of sweet paprika.",
				"8. Heat up 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan. Peel the onions and slice them into 3 mm slices \u2013 if you slice them too finely, they will dry out rather than caramelise.",
				"9. Add sliced onions to the pan, stir them well to coat them in the olive oil. Cook the onions on a very low heat (I used setting 2 out of 6) to soften them \u2013 to get them nice and caramelised, you mustn\u2019t rush the process.",
				"10. Once soft, add salt, sugar and balsamic vinegar and cook some more. Finally add a splash of water to deglaze the pan and gather all the sweet oniony goodness stuck to the pan. Continue cooking until the water cooks out."

I added lots of olive oil, and even some cold water to get it to a dip consistency, but it was still dollop-able. But very tasty! Do you think it's just the high speed blender that gets it so creamy? I made mine in a regular food processor. Mine was also much paler - like beige coloured. I added some turmeric to pep it up a bit colour wise. We all enjoyed it though, especially with the onions and capers on top. Thanks for the recipe :-)",

				"Fava is one of those Greek recipes that found it's way to my kitchen too and never left. I put my own tweak on it of course, as I always do. Never ask me to follow a recipe exactly :DI fry onion, garlic and grated carrot first in the pot. Then add water , salt and fava, let it boil until it's very soft and then I don't blender it because my family likes it like that (in the North a very similar dish is done with pork and eaten around Easter, maybe you have it Poland too). In the very end I add fresh dill and parsley. So the idea started with fava and ended up being something completely different :D My Greek man who doesn't like the traditional fava, loves my creation. ;)"

				"HIi! This recipe sounds great, I'm planning on having it as a side dish for a dinner party and wondering, in addition to the sauce and the rice, whether I can prep anything else the day before? will the tofu stay crispy? Am assuming I can't make the entire thing the day before?Thanks!",

				"That looks amazing! Actually, as I scrolled down, the first thing I saw was the big vat of chili paste, so I was primed to like whatever came next! :) Thanks!",
				"Super! Really want to make it tonight. Is it a problem if I make the rice a few hours in advance instead of a day?Thanks! Greetings from the Netherlands",
				"Hi and thanks for your wonderful recipes! This one did ot work for me and I wonder what happened.  The chiles got completely fried at 425 for five minutes and then I decided to just soak some more of them and roast the garlic and ginger.  The ginger got hard and unworkable and the garlic browned but did not soften.  Any ideas?  Yours look great.Thanks, Sita"

Once you coat the insides of your cups, put them into the freezer for 15 minutes or so.

You\u2019ll need to scrape the walls of the blender with a silicone spatula from time to time. Once the first portion of cashews is super creamy, add remaining cashews in 3 batches, processing until creamy and smooth after each batch. When it comes to the final, fourth batch the mixture will be very creamy and heavy \u2013 to help the blender, you may need take the lid of when blending, dip the tip of your spatula in the mixture and make circles (in the direction of the turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture. This will help you achieve a super creamy and smooth finish without the need for a power blender, but be careful not to dip the spatula so low that it catches on the working blades. Taste the mixture and add another tablespoon of maple syrup if desired, plus a few drops of vanilla essence to taste.",

Once the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat, but keep the bowl over the hot water. Gently stir in \u00bd cup / 120 ml of the cashew cream you\u2019ve just made. Dissolve instant coffee in 1 tablespoon of warm water and add it to the mixture.

This is one of the few recipes that doesn't feel like it's missing something. I used a chia egg instead of aquafava and it turned out phenomenal, as long as you're not concerned about little flecks in your rolls.",

				"These look like an awesome treat, I absolutely love dates in baked goods. While they aren't actually sugar-free (they contain quite a lot of natural sugars, so this recipe wouldn't be great for diabetics), they're not refined sugar. I'm sure they would make a nice, sticky filling for cinnamon rolls! And congratulations on your successful procedure! Not being able to drink coffee would be torture. I saw in a comment from two years ago that you hadn't tried any alternative flours. Has that changed? If not I totally understand! I've switched to a mostly wheat-free lifestyle due to stomach issues, and while dairy and other substitutions tend to be fairly straightforward, wheat can be a pain. Either way, I will definitely be using the date filling recipe to fill my Christmas cinnamon rolls this year! Thanks!",

No more cinnabon cravings!!Out of curiosity, i had to calculate nutritional info for the whole thing based on 10 cinnabons, and they turned out to be either 196 calories per piece if used half the amount of dates mentioned (like my case, paste was runny so couldn't use more than half), or  225 calories if used the entire date paste mix. In comparison to the actua Cinnabon, that one has 800+ calories! I'd much rather enjoy my home made, cruelty free ones with zero guilt  :D",

Place washed beetroots in the middle of a large piece of kitchen foil. Holding the edges of the foil up with one hand, drizzle a bit of water to the bottom of the parcel so that the beetroots cook in their own steam. Scrunch the edges of the foil above the beetroots to create a parcel. Bake until you can easily pierce each beetroot with a knife (about 60 min, depending on the beetroot\u2019s size). Once the beetroots are cool enough to handle, peel the skin off.",
				"2. Pour cold aquafaba and lemon juice to the bottom of the blender (or a food processor, but blender will give you a smoother hummus) with all the tahini, roughly sliced beetroots and chickpeas.",
				"3. Process until smooth. If the mixture is a bit too thick, trickle more aquafaba (or cold water) through the opening in the lid. Once the mixture becomes homogeneous and thick and your average blender starts to struggle (if you have a Vitamix or a similar hi-tech blender you probably will not need to worry about this) start making circles on the surface of your hummus mixture (in the direction of the turning blades) with a spatula (don\u2019t dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades). This simple action will prevent air pockets forming under the mixture\u2019s surface, helping your blender process the heavy mixture.\nFinally, season the mixture with salt, cumin, garlic and extra lemon juice if you like.\nTo serve, put hummus in a bowl. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil (if you don\u2019t care about it being oil-free), sprinkle some sesame seeds and chopped parsley on top.",

				"Hey Ania- I love your site and the recipe that I am commenting on is old but new to me and looks delicious- I can't wait to try it! I really appreciate all your work here and am a big fan in general. I want to say something very gently about the way you talk about food on your blog. You often speak about food as evil or dangerous or tell the reader that things are not healthy. I find this puzzling, and a little sad, and difficult to read for me personally with a history of disordered eating- it comes across as putting so much shame along with food. I wanted to gently ask if you could be mindful of the language that you use around food. If we can all reframe how we talk about food to remove moral language, then it will create a world with better mental and physical health. Thank you.",

I was quite nervous about experimenting with aquafaba, but once it started to foam up as i was beating it, i was highly relieved! I will definitely be making these again, thanks for the recipe!",

Would you/have you substituted gluten free all purpose flour (rice base, not dried bean base)?Thanks So Much!",
				"Hi there, I made these yesterday and they taste  great, however my batter was runnier then yours and the brookies ended up flat and sticking to the paper. I used 90ml of chickpea liquid  for aquafaba, but was I supposed to use 90ml of aqaufaba instead?  Aquafaba looked great and stiff , but perhaps I had too much of it. I measured everything else according to the recipe.",
				"Hi there, I used 90 ml of chickpea liquid which after beating it expanded a lot, so the volume looked like more, but maybe that's not where the problem lays. The aquafaba was really stiff although I used granulated sugar, not caster sugar. Would this create a problem? I didn't make any other substitutions.",
				"Hi Ania, I made them again, and  this time they were a SUCCESS  :). I beat the chickpea liquid for a very long time this time (my arm was numb afterwords :)) to make sure the aquafaba is really  really stiff  plus I was very careful when incorporating malted chocolate into it. I have added less sugar (just a personal preference) and I was very pleased with the result. Thank you for the great recipe, my family loves these so I will certainly making them again. Have a good day :)",
				"I tried the recipe today it was a disaster..I would appreciate your help. I don't eat choclate so used sweetened carob chips..followed the recipe exactly apart from the chocolate but after keeping in the oven they spread like a liquid. What could have happened?",

				"Ooops! I'd got too excited and scrolled straight to the recipe.  Sorry!  Explains why they aren't as light this time :(",
				"Do you whisk the flour mix in, or stir btw? I use sweetener so that'll be why they didn't go crispy :)Making second batch as we speak :)",

				"I just tried your recipe and it's delicious!  I used almond flour instead of hazelnut because that was what I had on hand. Mine are much thinner than yours but have a beautiful crackle top. It may be due to my inexperience with aquafaba, but no matter! Love them! Thanks!",
				"Can you replace the aquafaba for another egg-replacer?",
				"It's very tempting Can I use anything else than buckwheat as it's not easily available in city where I live",

I didn't have the lemon skin, so substituted dried cranberries for the lemon and sultanas. It was so good that way that it's hard to imagine how wonderful if I'd had all the proper gubbins!

				"I love, love, LOVE this salad. Probably my favourite one of all time. I decided to leave a review because I've made this recipe many times with various substitutions/alterations and hope that this info might help someone else out :- firstly, I make this without any nuts on it pretty much all of the time because they're too expensive for me to afford at the moment, even though this dish is absolutely DELISH with a bit of crunch. If you don't have any nuts on hand, please don't let it stop you from making this!!- I've made this with julienned/shredded carrot instead of red cabbage when I didn't have any on hand, and have also made it with red cabbage but using carrot instead of cucumber when I was out of that ingredient. If you're planning on eating this over a few days, I HIGHLY recommend subbing out the cucumber for carrot - the salad maintains it's freshness for much longer and doesn't get soggy. - I have made this with both mint, coriander and a mix of both before. It definitely tastes best with a mix of both, however the mint does get soggy after a day while the coriander seems to maintain its freshness for up to 3 (possibly longer, but I've usually finished this salad beforehand - it makes around 3 standard portions or 2 large)- lastly, instead of sambal I use sriracha and it tastes AMAZING in this salad. Recently I have also been omitting the extra tablespoon of neutral oil and find that the dressing tastes much stronger this way and the flavour of the sesame oil really shines through!Thanks so much for sharing this lovely recipe! :)",
				"Was a big hit at our ladies lunch.  Will be making this again soon.",
				"Best salad recipe ever. It\u2019s a fam favourite and in my top 3 most requested dishes.  We have a young toddler so we leave out the chilli paste and it still tastes amazing. I love that it doesn\u2019t use fish sauce which can be a bit overpowering and gives me tummy issues. We tend to have it with some hard tofu that\u2019s been pan fried until crisp! . My hubby loves to take it to work in his esky because often the building sites have no microwaves. Keeps well for almost 3 days! Thanks so much.",
				"This is the best salad dressing ever!!! We love this salad and have made it many times now. So simple and delicious and you can change it up to suit different tastes though the roasted peanuts are an absolute must! Sooo good :D",
				"This was super easy and one of the most delicious meals we've had!",
				"This couldn't be any easier!!!  I use the same bowl for softening the noodles as I do serving the dish so there is little clean up!!  Sometimes I buy precut veggies so there is no excuse not to make dinner!!!  And it's so yummy and it is CHEAP!!!  Thanks for a great great recipe!!",
				"This looks amazing! How far in advance can I make this?",
				"\u015awietna jest ta sa\u0142atka! Robi\u0119 ju\u017c chyba 6 raz i smakuje mi coraz bardziej. Pozdrowienia z Holandii.",
				"Wow!  Almost too gorgeous to eat!  I did say almost.  I will have one with a Thai Ice Tea please!  Love the photos and can hardly wait to try the recipe.",
				"Yum! This looks so bright and colourful. And your food photography is stunning. Will definitely need to try this some day.",
				"I think I will have to make a vat of this dressing. I use a similar blend on my tofu stir fry, but it never occurred to me to use it cold on rice noodles in a salad. This is why I need and love your site so much. :)  And this is such an easy salad to throw together with  fresh goodies from the garden. Thanks for another winner!"

			"title": "Vegan tarte tatin",
			"ingredients": [
				"1.2 kg / 2.6 lb apples (I used Granny Smith)",
				"130 g / \u00bd cup + 2 tbsp caster sugar OR 150 ml / \u00bd cup + 2 tbsp maple syrup",
				"45 ml / 3 tbsp olive oil (mild tasting)",

				"\u00bd vanilla pod",
				"1 tbsp brandy",
				"400 g vegan puff pastry"
			],
			"time": "55 min",
			"serving": "makes 24 cm / 9.5\"",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and cut out the core using a pairing knife.",
				"2. Put the caster sugar or maple syrup, olive oil, star anise, cardamom pods and cinnamon stick into a 24 cm / 9.5\u2033 ovenproof frying pan / skillet.",
				"3. Scrape the seeds from the half a vanilla pod and put them and the pod itself into the pan.",
				"4. Place on a medium heat and give it a good stir. If using sugar, the mixture will look like an olive oil granita until the sugar melts into the oil. After a few minutes of gentle bubbling, the mixture will separate, turn an amber colour and start to bubble more vigorously. Watch the mixture carefully and the minute the sugar turns dark amber (don\u2019t push it too far as it will burn), take the pan off the heat.",
				"5. Add the cut apple pieces into the pan gradually, coat them in the caramel mixture and start to simmer on a low heat. As the apple starts to shrink you should then be able to fit all of the apple pieces in the pan. Caramelise the apples for another 15 minutes until they turn golden. Move the pieces around the pan so that they caramelise at the same pace. The sides touching the pan will cook quicker so if some pieces look more done than others, remove them from the pan and set aside on a small plate so that the other pieces have a chance to catch up.",
				"6. Add brandy and simmer for another 10 minutes (until the apple pieces are the same colour as the 2nd and 3rd photo). By the end, the apples should be pre-cooked enough that you should be able to insert a skewer into the flesh with a considerable amount of resistance.",
				"7. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F.",
				"8. Leave the apple mixture to cool for 15 minutes so that you can handle the apples with your hands. At this point arrange the apple pieces on a side, in a spiral shape. Make sure the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, vanilla pod and star anise are on the pan itself so they can be removed easily once the tart is cooked.",
				"9. Roll out the puff pastry to 3 mm / 0.1\u2033 and, using a plate that is slightly larger than the pan, cut out a circle of pastry.",
				"10. Drape the pastry over the pan and make sure you tuck in all the edges down the side of the pan. This will give you that rustic tarte tatin crust.",
				"11. Pierce the pastry 3-5 times with a skewer to allow the steam to escape and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.",
				"12. Turn the oven temperature down to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F and cook for a further 15-25 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Be careful not to burn yourself when removing the pan out of the oven as the pan\u2019s handle will be piping hot.",
				"13. Leave the tart to cool for at least 15 minutes (making sure the pan handle has cooled from the oven!). Place a plate on top of the pan and, holding the plate against the pan, flip the pan upside down",
				"14. Serve on its own or with some vanilla ice cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche."

I really liked your instructions, particularly the way you staggered the apple frying to fit as many as possible in the tarte.

Process until fairly smooth. You will need to use a spatula initially to scrape down the mixture that stays on the walls of the blender. Once the first portion of the cashews is fairly smooth, slowly start adding the remaining cashews, blending well after each addition.",
				"7. Since you are not using agar, you simply need to add minimum amount of liquid (that includes coconut cream or/and water) to the cashews in order to retain thick consistency without the need for a thickener. At some point your blender will struggle to process the mixture as it will be very thick and heavy. To remedy this, take blender\u2019s lid off and make small circles (in the direction of the turning blades), with a spatula, a few millimetres below the surface of the cheese mixture to help the blades turn. Please be very careful not to dip the spatula too deep or too close to the blades as it will damage them.",
				"8. Season with miso (see notes), nutritional yeast, salt and pepper, dry herbs, garlic and more lemon if you like your cheese on the tangy side. Transfer it to a jar and place in the fridge. It will become thicker and spreadable by the next day."

				"Pretty good recipe. I feel like the flavoring is good! I can\u2019t remember what ricotta tastes like, but I like this! Lol. Solid substitute I\u2019m sure. I did it the no agar way and it turned out great. I remember ricotta not being that stiff of a cheese anyway, so I\u2019m curious how the agar one turns out as I feel like the no agar recipe is spot on with consistency.",
				"This is the best vegan cheese I have tried. I also made your spanakopita recipe  that uses this cheese for Christmas and it was delicious. Thank you very much :)",
				"I attempted this ricotta recipe today to add to your pumpkin ravioli recipe. The ravioli dough and pumpkin filling have gone well. But this recipe completely flopped and I can't figure out why. It tasted tangy and fizzy at the end, so bad I had to bin it all after attempting to rescue it with sugar and bicarb soda. They only made it taste worse.Perhaps you have an idea where I went wrong. I'm wondering if it's because I used lime juice rather than lemon juice? Or perhaps I used the wrong type of miso. I also did a quick boil with line for the cashews as I forgot to do then overnight. I tasted the coconut milk and miso as I thought they could be the culprits, but both tasted fine, they hadn't gone bad. Do you have any thoughts to what was my clearly huge mistake?Thanks so much",
				"Could you share what we can use the cheese for? Can it be baked on pizza? Will it melt like normal cheese?",
				"I made this and used it for zucchini lasagna and it was delicious! In the recipe I wouldn't have known it wasn't really ricotta if I hadn't made it myself. Thanks for another awesome recipe!",
				"Hi Thanks for this recipe. Just made my second batch it's fab. Can you freeze it ?  It's just that I waste the coconut cream otherwise.Thanks again",
				"I tried your ricotta recipe for the spanakopita. I would have to say that the flavour and texture is very good but the coconut taste is overwhelming, and I love coconut. I wonder if I could try it again without the coconut fat because now I am scared the spanakopita will not taste right.  Since I hate wasting food I will give it a go with the recipe as it is. Maybe with the filling it won't be as strong. Fingers crossed!",
				"I love this! I first made it for ravioli, but my favourite use for it has been to top lasagna. I've never been able to get that crispy baked top with any other vegan cheese. I can finally make the perfect vegan lasagna.",
				"Hello AniaMy husband and I watched a documentary on Netflix a few days ago named \"What the Health\". We were so shocked that the same evening, we decided to become vegans.It is a huge steps. I am a senior citizen, and my husband is not far behind. We are also very excited, and up to the challenge. One of the dish I made so many times in my life is the spanakopita. I am thrilled to see that you are offering a vegan version, and am really looking forward to trying your ricotta cheese. Thank you for the work that you do. You are contributing to making the world a better place.Marie-Andree Cossette",
				"Hi Ania,Just curious- can you taste the coconut in the end result?Thanks!",
				"Awesome, thanks for the quick reply!",
				"Hi,I have to manage a cashew allergy (as well as dairy)...Do you think this recipe could work with almonds?Thank you!",
				"This looks amazing!  I love cheese, but can't eat it too often because of a slight dairy allergy.  Ricotta is one of the hardest cheeses to replicate because of the texture and subtle flavor.  This one looks spot on!  I'll be trying it soon.  Thanks for sharing!",
				"Looks delicious.  One question:  the coconut cream, do you just use the solid part  or the liquid part, or mix the two together and use that?  Thank you.",
				"OOOH I cannot wait to try this! I have a cannelloni recipe that I am craving but can no longer have because of my dairy intolerance. I think you may have just solved this problem for me!! L x ",
				"It looks so tasty, Ania!  Since I have all the ingredients I will try it this weekend. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Hi Ania, Looks good! I will try this once I round up the ingredients.fyi: sometime ago, I read an old review of a dish of long green beans with fermented bean curd served at an iconic restaurant in Vancouver's China Town. The review described the fermented bean curd as tasting like parmesan. Since, then I have been meaning try it.On my last trip to the Asian Market in Kelowna, I purchased a teeny, tiny bottle of 'Che Che Fermented Bean Curd in Sesame Oil' (with chill). I was hesitant to try something so 'exotic', but at the first taste, I found it to be reminiscent of Cambazola, if it were marinated in sesame-chili oil. It is savoury, salty and has a kick of spice. The only veg I had to try it on was steamed, farm fresh cabbage. Not it's best pairing.  Next I tried it on toasted rounds of baguette. A win. It would be even better on Carr's Water Crackers.Katy",

				"This was absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe. I was transported to my favorite childhood Italian restaurant---like a Ratatouille moment--- was it something in the tomato sauce? The balsamic? Crushed roasted garlic? Minced capers?? Anyway, I didn't have pine nuts on hand and used pumpkin seeds instead. I figured the toasted seed would really add texture to the pasta and it did. The pumpkin seed was a fine substitution, but I'll have to try with the buttery pine nut next time. Absolutely loved the technique of roasting the garlic in the pan with its skin on. My mind is blown. I must buy more fennel and make this dish again!",
				"I made this yesterday & it was delicious!Super easy to make.Tasted healthy too.Definitely making this again :)",
				"Hi Ania,Just tried this recipe today and the flavors were wonderful.  However, I found that my fennel seemed really hard on the inside and uncooked.  The outside was charred, but the inside was not at all softened.

Any tips would be appreciated!    Thank you!",

				"4. Put cooled, peeled beans into a blender or a food processor. In my experience an upright blender will give you a smoother and creamier spread. Put peeled beans, walnut butter, garlic, lemon juice, salt and liquid smoke (if using) into a blender. Put the lid on and start trickling cold liquid in slowly while mixture is blending. Once the mixture starts churning, make small circles with the tip of your spatula (in the direction of turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture (do not dip the spatula deeper than literally a few millilitres or else you will damage the blades). This will help to burst an air pocket under the surface and helps the motor to turn. If using a food processor, put peeled beans and all the remaining ingredients in apart from aquafaba or water. Process until you get a coarse crumb and then start pouring in the cold liquids while the food processor is running. Adjust the liquid content to achieve the right consistency. Be careful not to add too much liquid so that the spread doesn\u2019t drip off your toast.",
				"5. To make balsamic glaze, put balsamic vinegar and maple syrup in a very small pot. Bring them both to a gentle boil and then decrease the heat and simmer until the mixture resembles a thin syrup. Take it off the heat and set aside to cool down \u2013 it will get thicker and more syrupy once it cools down. If it becomes apparent that you have reduced it too much, add a small splash of water to loosen the consistency a little.",
				"6. Spread smoky white bean hummus on toasted bread, put nectarine slices on top and drizzle with balsamic syrup. Decorate with chopped pistachios and mint leaves."

				"Hi Ania, I finally got round to trying this and it was really fantastic. That dressing - oh my!! I adapted the contents of the salad a bit - didn`t have any red cabbage  but used carrot and celery and zucchini (courgette) strips plus (vegan) Chinese noodles to pad it out. Coriander and cashews as stated, nearly didn`t bother to open my pack of black sesame seeds, but so glad I did - just gave it such an elegant finish! Can`t eat garlic any more, unfortunately, but it didn`t even need it - still tasted wonderful. Big hit with the family, too. Will definitely be making this again. Looked so good I wished I did instagram and could show it to everyone!!",

				"Wow, i love it i always to go to Wagamama then i wat Veg katsu curry",
				"Thanks For Sharing this amazing recipe. My family loved it. I will be sharing this recipe with my friends. Hope the will like it.",
				"Yum! This Katsu curry sauce is amazing. I only had a red apple so used that and it worked well. Thanks again for another tasty recipe.",
				"Hi, can the sauce be frozen?",
				"Hi - thanks for sharing this recipe. I was wondering if you could please tell me if it's ok not to add the apple (I will in future, but don't have one on hand) Thank you",
				"Do you salt the aubergines first",
				"Ooh very nice,I adapted it a smidge, used butternut squash+ sweet potato in the sauce,I think your recipe is absolutely superb,it has opened up so many avenues and options for us. Thank you.",
				"Really enjoy using this recipe - it has become my go to when I want to make katzu curry! I love that the sauce is spicy, tangy and a little sweet. Delicious!",
				"I can't wait to try this!! I've been craving a katsu curry since Wagamama closed. I was wondering if I could replace the aquafaba with flax eggs?Thanks!",
				"Hi, my husband has allergies to pitted fruits including apples. What can I use as a replacement ? Can I just leave it out all together. Will it still be as good?",
				"Can I use normal egg or egg whites instead of aquafaba?",
				"I made this tonight for dinner after having it at a friend's a few weeks ago and once again it was delicious!! I have lots of sauce left over so I  enjoyed reading people's suggestions on how to use it.",
				"I have always eaten the curry out of the package.  It had a really distinct flavor unlike the curry of other Asian countries, and I didn't know where it came from or how to recreate it without all the MSG.  This was AMAZING!  I didn't have much luck with the frying (it was difficult to get the panko to stick), so I will try something different next time.",
				"We made this curry to go with some storebought vegan katsu cutlets from fieldroast, we loved it!  The apple and ginger really meld with the miso, so nice!  Will have to try making the cutlets sometime.",
				"This dish was amazing, we really enjoyed it. However it took absolutely ages to make, around about 3 hours! Wouldn\u2019t reccomend if you\u2019re pushed for time. The end result was delicious so it was worth it.",
				"Hi Ania, I am hoping to try this tonight and wondered how much oil you use to fry the aubergine/sweet potato. Is it a shallow fry-just lining the pan or does it need more oil- like deep frying. I can\u2019t wait to try this recipe- sounds amazing!! I\u2019ve tried a few of your recipes and they don\u2019t disappoint x",
				"Thanks, thanks, thanks !!! I used to live in London and loved this dish, but now I live in Sevilla where there is no Wagamama. I just followed your recipe and the curry sauce is exactly as I remembered. Thank you again! You made my day!",
				"This was a great recipe - so yummy! We can't wait to make it again now that we're familiar with the recipe and can keep track of the moving parts a bit better. Thank you for sharing. :)",
				"This was delicious, both tasty and satisfying! Thank you for your recipes. We are trying to eat less meat and your website makes it easy   and even exciting!",
				"Cooked this tonight as I've been craving the wagamamas version for a while and this totally satisfied my craving!I didn't have apples so didn't use them but will do next time, although I think the taste of the dish was still great. I also used almond milk instead of aquafaba and it worked absolutely fine. Nice, crispy coating.Thanks so much for sharing this recipe as it's non-complicated and not too time consuming but super yummy!",
				"Hi, I love this recipe but I'm having problems making it \"crispy\" the eggplant is soggy and greasy afterwards, what do you recommend for this? I love this idea and the flavour, but I dread eating a veggie that is super oily (even though I am deep frying them when the oil is very hot)",
				"This is an awesome recipe thank u so much :) ive been wanting a replacement to the version a known restaurant here in Australia called Don Don's havd but their vegetarian option actually has chicken stock, and i've found it here.",
				"I just made this dish for my parents! I'm used to only cooking for myself (I'm not as picky ;) ) but they really enjoyed it as well! For once I actually followed the recipe exactly and it all came together so nicely. It feels so rewarding, especially since the recipe called for ingredients i normally don't use :) When I was living abroad my Japanese friend always went on about Japanese curry and how she'd make it for us one day. It never happened and now we live in different countries. But after making this I definitely understand why she was so enthusiastic about it! Thanks so much for a great recipe :)",
				"Just have to comment on this. Made it on Sunday and daughter flipped out! It was amazing! \"Who needs meat?!\" we said to ourselves.  We lived in Japan for 17 years and this was just the right taste - the real deal! Great idea to put miso into curry sauce - would never have thought of it. Had bought some white miso (2 years ago?! Where did the time go to?) but never got round to using it. It was black not white, but still smelled good and tasted fine. Will definitely be making this again!",
				"Never heard of Aubergine!! Seriously. I have been cooking for 50 years and I have no idea.",
				"Wow! Wow! Wow!I had this dish at Wagamama's and loved it ... so you can imagine my joy when I saw your recipe, especially a veganised version! Thanks",
				"Amazing!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I use the curry sauce for all sorts, pizza topping, dip with naan ..."

I put it in a pot with a see through lid. I let the water come to boil and then turn the heat right down (setting 2 out of 6). I check that all of the water has been absorbed by tilting the pot slightly and seeing if any water is seeping out. Once the water has been fully absorbed, I switch the heat off but KEEP THE LID ON.

				"1. Soak dry chickpeas in plenty of water (chickpeas should be well covered) for about 8 hours. I tend to leave them to soak overnight.",
				"2. Discard soaking water and rinse the chickpeas. Place them into a pot, which you have a lid for and cover with 8 cups of water. Do not add any salt or baking soda.",
				"3. Cover the pot with a lid and bring to the boil. Be careful as chickpeas like to boil over if the heat is too high so keep an eye on them until they come to boil. Skim the foam that has come to the top and discard.",
				"4. After the chickpeas come to boil, decrease the heat to low-medium and simmer the chickpeas (with a lid on) until tender. It takes about 60-75 minutes.",
				"5. Once the chickpeas are ready, turn the heat off and leave the chickpeas to cool down in its cooking water (this infuses the cooking water with more protein, which gives aquafaba its miraculous properties of an egg white).",
				"6. Remove chickpeas from the cooking water with a slotted spoon. Make sure the spoon is clean and has no grease residue on it as even trace amounts of grease inhibit aquafaba\u2019s foaming properties \u2013 this is especially important if you intend to whip your aquafaba into a meringue.",
				"7. Depending on the intended application of your aquafaba, you may want to reduce the liquid a little to make it more potent. I find that this is especially necessary for when you intent to use it as a binder, in vegan meatballs for example. Please remember also that the more reduced the liquid the more intense chickpea flavour will be so when you intent to use it for desserts, like meringues or chocolate mousse, you do not need to reduce as much or at all. To reduce aquafaba, return the remaining cooking water to the stove. Set the heat to low-medium and reduce aquafaba (without a lid) for about 30-45 minutes until some of the water evaporates and you are left with thick yellow liquid.",
				"8. Let the reduced liquid come to room temperature and then transfer to a clean container and store in the fridge \u2013 once chilled aquafaba will turn gelatinous and resemble an egg white. If you are not in a rush to use your aquafaba, pop cooked chickpeas back into the container with aquafaba and store them together overnight \u2013 this will make aquafaba even more gelatinous. Store in an air-tight container for 3-4 days."

				"My aquafaba turned out very dark.  I do not think it effected the taste but if I decided to make meringue kisses, I'd like them to be very white.  What can I do to get it lighter?",
				"Hi..Can I use this aquafaba in baking cakes?",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Almost everywhere on the web recommends to just buy canned chickpeas for the water, but I always make my own  beans in the Instapot.  I made my garbanzos last night in the Instapot late, so I just let it sit overnight to cool.  This morning much of the water was gelatinous and stuck to the peas at the bottom of the pot.  I think (?) I had no choice but to rinse them just a bit to separate the pecs from the water.  I will probably end up having to boil down the water as you suggested, is there another way I could\u2019ve approached this? I won\u2019t be using the water right away but I do plan on using the beans today.",
				"Thanks a lot Ania for your clear cut instructions to make aquafaba. I just came across aquafaba in a meringue recipe n was wondering what it is.  Hoping to try making it soon.",
				"In your photo, the meringues look pretty bright. Were those made with aquafaba?I never get white meringues no matter which recipe or temperature variation I try.Is there a tip to getting them to look so bright?",
				"Great recipe, thanks! 1st time making this and it was enjoyed by my family and friends. Thank you.",
				"This looks so good. I should try it.Thank yor for sharing this unique recipe!",
				"Hi! Thank you so much for the idea!Please forgive my silly question:I was wondering.., if the liquid is yellow.. how It will be white at the end?",
				"Hi Ania,I am so excited to try this.  I wonder can we make Aquafaba with soya beans?They seem so similar?Thankyou.",
				"Finding this super frustrating. Followed the instructions to the letter, including reducing. I\u2019ve been left with yellow water. Certainly nothing like the consistency\u2019s the aquafaba  from tinned chickpeas. It\u2019s been left in the fridge for two days, with the peas in too. :(",
				"The aquafaba thickens into a gel when refrigerated with the chickpeas in the liquid. This actually makes the best aquafaba.  Even though  the thick gel is yellow, itwill turn white when whipped. And it works fine mixed with ground Flax without whipping as a binder for quick breads or muffins or pancakes.",
				"Any tips for making this using a slow cooker? Usually we cook dry beans on low overnight.",
				"thank you for sharing! i want to ask. do we have to peel the chickpea's skin off ? is it necessary  ?",
				"Hi! Thank you for sharing all your tips!I have a question regarding to reducing the aquafaba as you say it\u2019s better not to do it if you\u2019re are using it for meringues. I\u2019m planning to try this recipe to make macarons and I wanted to know if you recommend me to reduce it a little bit or not. I\u2019ve tried making meringues plenty of times with homemade aquafaba but succeeded only the first time haha :( so I hope that following this tips I\u2019ll be able to make it right!",
				"Thanks for this info, Ania! Have you tried making aquafaba with an Instantpot? I can make chickpeas in about an hour from dry in an Instantpot, now I'm curious about the water. I'll try saving it next time, I'd love to make some mayo. Thanks for this inspiration!",
				"I\u2019m planning to freeze some small batches of this. Any tricks to freezing and thawing I should know about? This is my first time making my own aquafaba. Also, another question.... when making things with aquafaba, for example mayo, should it be used within the 3-4 day threshold?",
				"How much would an individual use in proportion of 1 egg?",
				"Hi Ania, thanks so much for this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, including reducing the cooking liquid for about an hour. I was concerned with how thin the liquid seemed when it put it in the refrigerator with some of the cooked chickpeas. When I pulled it out of the refrigerator in the morning, my aquafaba was perfectly gelatinous and my vegan mayo had a much better texture than when I used the liquid from canned chickpeas!  I ended up with about 3 1/2 cups of aquafaba, so I had plenty to freeze for future use."

Served it with Confit rabbit legs, it was perfect.My only twist was none of the herbs you suggest, I didn\u2019t think it needed it, and more important, I cooked it the day before so that flavors had time to develop. We all felt like we were in Provence for one night! Yes, I know Caponata is Italian, but frequently served in Provence as well!"

				"I must say that these are one of the best things that I have ever eaten. I LOVE them!!! I couldn't stop eating and now I must make a second batch. Thank you for this amazing recipe!",
				"These look so good.  Do you think these can be made in the oven?",
				"I just made these.  They were lovely!  I didn\u2019t have a big enough sieve so I wrapped  the zucchini in a clean tea towel, gave it a bit of a squeeze  and then sat the bundle in the sieve I have.  After wringing them out again, the zucchini was very dry!",
				"Do you think I could sub some of the zucchini for grated carrot without detracting from the dish?",
				"I didn't make these yet, but I usually bake things like that in the oven for 25-35 min  at 350 F  This way I need less oil and i flipp them once after half the time.",
				"Delicious once I got them right. First batch was an absolute mess. Then I added another 1/2 c flour and 1/4 bread crumbs (or more... I just kept going until it firmed up a bit). For me, it took more than 2 minutes to fry. Closer to 8 minutes for one side. Flipping them was work. They were so sticky and I had to move my spatula under the fritters with such care. I also couldn't fry as many at a time as I thought because I needed the room on the pan for maneuvering the spatula. I used all gluten free ingredients, so my theory is that it must have changed the consistency. I will use regular flour and bread crumbs next time and see if its less of a pain! Did anyone else have this issue? Maybe next time I will spread the zucchini on a baking sheet to get rid of extra moisture at the start. Squeezing the zucchini got rid of tons of water but maybe getting rid of even more would have made them less sticky too.... anyone else with the same experience?",

				"It was really helpful! though I adjusted a bit to my tastes and products I had. thanks for recipe!",
				"I made them yesterday and really liked them. Also the cold leftovers were a great snack. Next time I will continue baking them in the oven after frying, now they were still a bit doughy in the middle. Oh, and I covered the patties in bread crumbs before frying to add to the crispiness :) thank you for the recipe!"

I added a pinch of cayenne powder to the coconut cream and mixed well before whisking it in as indicated on step 4.   The popcorn  turned out delicious.!! The hardest part for me was mixing the caramel and popcorn well to make sure that the caramel coats all the kernels.   By the way, have you tried to make Wasabi-flavoured popcorn?  So far, I have tasted the Bonsai brand and wish I could make it at home.",
				"Hi Ania,I cannot tell which kind of wasabi was used in the recipe.  All I know is that the popcorn is light and spicy  - the right amount of salt and heat.  The accurate name of this popcorn is Lesser Evil Buddha Bowl Foods Organic Popcorn Bonsai Wasabi.  The bag listed the following ingredients: Organic non-GMO popcorn, organic coconut oil, organic wasabi seasoning (organic evaporated cane sugar, organic tapioca solids, Himalayan salt, organic spinach powder, organic ground mustard, natural oil or mustard).  Perhaps the mustard provides a bit of sourness? At any rate, thank you for experimenting with Asian and other flavors and sharing your creations with us!!",

				"4. In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt, cumin and drained and cooled quinoa. Add about 6 tbsp of cold water (if using chickpea flour you may need a touch more as it appears more absorbent) and mix well. If you are using wheat flour make sure you do not overmix or else crackers will be tough.",
				"5. Brush baking paper with a bit of oil and then spread the cracker mixture very thinly over the paper in several thin strips / blotches. Press it down with the spoon to make sure the layer is super thin with an occasional hole peeking out here and there \u2013 this will make your crackers light and crispy. Just make sure the cracker mixture is spread in the same manner everywhere or else it won\u2019t cook evenly.",
				"6. Bake for 15 mins on one side and then flip over to the other side and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until crispy and golden. Remove from the oven and cool down.",
				"7. Put peeled chickpeas (this will make your hummus smoother) into an upright blender together with roasted carrots, tahini, 4 tbsp of lemon juice, garlic and salt. Switch the appliance on and start trickling in cold aquafaba. You need to add enough to enable your blender to churn the mixture without any issues (hummus thickens as it rests so do not panic if it seems like a lot of liquid). In order to help the motor work the thick mixture, make small circles with the tip of your spatula/or a knife (in the direction of turning blades) on the surface of the revolving mixture (do not dip the spatula deeper than literally a few millimetres or else you will damage the blades). This will help to burst an air pocket under the surface and helps the motor to churn. You can also use a food processor but in my experience the hummus will be less smooth.",
				"8. Finally add chilli to your taste (I used \u00bd tsp for a bit of a kick) and more lemon juice (I used 6 tbsp in total) if you like.",
				"9. Serve alongside quinoa crackers. Store leftover hummus in an airtight container in the fridge, it keeps for about 3-4 days."

				"1. Prepare rice noodles according to the instructions on the packet, but do not cook them fully as you\u2019ll give them another minute or two in the wok after. After you immerse them in soaking water, lift the lid and give the noodles a good stir to prevent them from clumping together and sticking to the bottom of the pot. Give them another good stir half way through the soaking time.",
				"2. Once the time is up, drain the noodles and set aside. You may want to stir a little bit of oil through them to prevent them from sticking together but I do not find this necessary.",
				"3. Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. If you are using a shop-bought tamarind puree / paste, go easy on it at first as it is apparently more concentrated (and therefore more sour) than if you make your paste from a tamarind block (see notes) yourself.",
				"4. Heat up a wok or a large frying pan. Pour 1 tbsp of oil and heat it up until almost smoking. Add spring onions, garlic and chilli.",
				"5. Stir-fry (stirring constantly) until spring onions soften and garlic becomes fragrant. Transfer to a separate plate, leaving as much oil in the wok as you can.",
				"6. Heat up another tablespoon of oil in the same wok \u2013 no need to wash it. Start adding prepared veggies in the following order (leaving a minute or two between each addition): broccoli, peas, red pepper and carrot ribbons. Stir-fry until cooked yet still crunchy.",
				"7. Transfer all vegetables to a big plate and pour the sauce to the bottom of the wok. Add in noodles \u2013 they may have clumped together a little, but the sauce and heat of the work will separate them again.",
				"8. Add spring onions, chilli, garlic and stir-fried veg back to the wok. Mix everything well and let it warm up, stirring the whole time, for a minute or two.",
				"9. Divide between two plates, sprinkle with sprouts and crushed peanuts. Serve with lime wedges on the side."

				"Made this on three occasions now, as I don't eat meat but do eat  shellfish I added prawns and it worked just as well. Nothing short of amazing best tasting home cooked pad Thai ever",
				"Just made this tonight. I had tamarind paste, and so just used a good teaspoon of it, with 2 Tbs maple syrup. I didn\u2019t have vegan fish sauce so just used all tamari. I added some fried tofu and mushrooms and it was delicious. Thank you for the recipe!",
				"THIS WAS AMAZING!!! The BEST vegan pad thai I've ever done. Thank you again, i do your recipes every other day I swear.Some ingreidents changes:- I had no vegan fish sauce so I just subbed for more tamari.-- I added baked tempeh to it just because i'm in love with tempeh (and I had no mung beans.)It was divine!",
				"best homemade pad thai i have made by far! used a tamarind  block to make the sauce and turned out so delicious",
				"5stars! I just made this lovely  recipe and will definitely make it again. I added a bit of cabbage, water and soya sauce as it was a bit dry but was an easy fix and really super!!! Well done!",
				"Hello!Just wondering when making the Tamarind sauce - does the tamarind block + soaking water go in the blender? Thanks!",
				"It was really nice and simple!! I didn't have fish sauce, but seaweed in the sauce was good enough to give some fish flavour ;)",
				"Hi  Ania,  do you have Nutritional Facts for this recipe? If so, I would greatly appreciate them. Thank You",
				"Made it for a second time. It is my new favorite. The taste is amazing and the instructions are easy to follow. Thank you!!!",
				"This is a great recipe.  I could not find Tamarind sauce, so I just did equal part limes to brown sugar.  I also could not find the fat noodles, so I did the egg noodles.   It was so delicious. What a great recipe.   Well worth the work!!!\ud83d\ude0dThanks so much!!!",
				"Dear Ania,Thank you so much for this recipe it was super tasty.I love Thai style foods but didn\u2019t know how to make them. Thank you again. From Jamie",
				"Interesting vegan version of Phad Thai! The recipe looks really attractive, and it is even ketogenic diet friendly! This is a perfect dish for a vegan-keto diet.  Sure, vegan diet and ketogenic diet sound imposssible since keto-diet  often includes meat as a source of protein, but vegan-keto doesn't have to include meat in their diets. There are several alternatives to meat, like tofu, tempeh, and seitan.  Vegan-keto diet may sound strict, but it offers promising health benefits. Plus, this recipe isn't a limitation to the diet, and this is a good start.",
				"This was amazing!I used Tamarind Concentrate (2 tbs) and  1 extra tbs of syrup. This was so easy and  quick. That's super important. I will be making again!Thanks!",
				"How would you suggest I cook tofu to add to this dish? Should I add it at a certain step? Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
				"So glad I came across your version. Can't wait to try it. Can I subsititue the rice noodles with whole wheat noodles?",
				"Amazing! I added tofu and cabbage and it's truly a wonderful recipe! Thank you! :)",
				"We just had it for dinner, It was yummy my Asian husband and mother in law loved it.  It was a bit dry ! Any Suggestions what to do to prevent noodles been dry next time ? Thank you so much for the recipe!",
				"Thanks for the lovely recipe! Notes for next time (and in case useful for others):- I used various different veggies (including a whole onion at the beginning, plus courgette and mushrooms later). - In the sauce mix I added 2 TBS peanut butter, a decent squirt of sriracha, and extra water as it was very thick. - I found my rice noodles were ready within 4 mins, not the 8 it said on the pack, so was glad I noticed that and could rescue them in time :) - Added firm tofu when cooking the onion+chilli+garlic with a splash of tamari.",
				"This was fabulous : tasty, full of vegetables, and colorful. I will make a couple changes next time:1. I will fry the garlic in a separate pan, as the garlic makes the bottom sticky2. I will try and remove the pits from the tamarind paste before I put it through the blender. I wasn't sure whether to blend in the water with the paste, but since it is called a sauce nat a paste, I believe the water had to go in the blender as well. I wasn't too sure how to put the sauce through a sieve (mine was probably much too fine), so I fished out the pits with my fingers.I had been looking for a good pad thai recipe for a while, and this is totally satisfying. No need to look any further: this is it. Thank you.",
				"Pad Thai is by far one of my favourite meals but have never quite found an easy and healthy vegan recipe. This was absolutely perfect, ticked all the boxes! Thank you! :)",
				"Thank you for a fantastic recipe.  Cooked it for my still omni husband and he loved it.  Definitely will like to make this again.  And I loved making my vegan fish sauce from scratch and picked tamarind pods and made that from scratch too.  A wonderful, tasty, balanced whole food meal!",
				"I made this today and loved it! It also went down well with my partner :D Thank you! X",
				"It was amazing! Loved it. I had vegan pad Thai in Brasserie Lola ,Paris at the weekend and came home craving it.... your recipe was spot on! Thank you Ania xx",
				"Hi , love how quick and tasty this vegan version is. I've cooked it a couple of times and  we've all enjoyed it!",
				"I made this for my family last night and it was superb! Thank you :)",
				"This looks amazing.  Thank you for this vegan version!  Cannot wait to try it.",
				"Thank you for this recipe, I'm gonna try it today. Was just wondering if I could add some grated  ginger. Do you think it would work?  Thank you",
				"Yum that looks so good! Love the beautiful photos :)",
				"Powinna\u015b wyda\u0107 ksi\u0105\u017ck\u0119, ch\u0119tnie bym kupi\u0142a.

				"\u00bc tsp baking soda",
				"6 tbsp / 3/8 cup raw cocoa powder",

				"200 g / 1 cup caster sugar",

				"30 g pistachios, chopped (optional)"
			],
			"time": "11-12 min",
			"serving": "makes 12 brownies",
			"recipe": [
				"1. If using flax or chia, prepare them by mixing 2 tbsp of ground seeds with 3 tbsp / 45 ml of water. Put aside in the fridge to allow it to thicken.",
				"2. Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Line a standard 12 hole muffin tin with cupcake liners or line the bottoms with circles of baking paper and insert a strip of baking paper into each hole to be able to take them out easily. Oil the sides of each muffin hole. Do not rely just on greasing the tin with olive oil alone as in my experience hardened tops are likely to come off when trying to remove brownies after baking (see the photo I put on my Instagram \u2013 @lazycatkitchen).",
				"3. Weigh your flour, add baking soda and mix the two together, sift. Set aside.",
				"4. Chop your chocolate very finely. Put it into a big mixing bowl, with cocoa powder and salt. Stir well.",
				"5. Boil a kettle of water and make an espresso. Make sure you time it so that they are both ready (and hot) at the same time. Pour 75 ml / 5 tbsp of boiling water and 60 ml / \u00bc cup of hot espresso into the bowl with chocolate. Stir it well until chocolate dissolves into hot liquid. Do not add any more liquid.",
				"6. Add in sugar, flax / chia egg (by this time it should turn all sticky) or cooled aquafaba and olive oil. Using a hand mixer, blend the mixture until it\u2019s smooth.",
				"7. It\u2019s time to add flour and the baking soda mixture. Add a little at a time and stir it into the chocolate mixture with a spoon. Do not be tempted to use an electric mixer as it will overwork the batter and spoil the brownies. Stir gently and just enough until there are no flour pockets any more, but no more than that.",
				"8. Spoon the\u00a0batter (it will be quite thick) into the muffin tin. Smooth it with a spatula and sprinkle chopped pistachios on top. Bake on middle shelf for about 11-12 minutes. Remember the brownies will continue to cook for a little while longer once removed from the oven and the tops will harden as they cool. The top should be nice and crispy, but the inside gooey. Remove them from the oven and let them sit in the tray until they are cool enough to remove. If you try to remove them too quickly, they may fall apart."

				"Hi Ania,Thank you for this recipe.  I'm confused about the liquids.  I thought that it was a total of 135 ml of liquid (\"Pour 75 ml / 5 tbsp of boiling water and 60 ml / \u00bc cup of hot espresso\").  But in your comments to Jaycie, you said 75ml total.  Would you please clarify as I would like to make sure to do the right thing!  Thank you so much and have a great day!",
				"Hi! Love your recipes <3I don't normally drink coffee but have some instant in the house at the moment. How much should I use (e.g. how many tablespoons to how much water) to make an espresso?And then I imagine I add five tablespoons of hot water on top of that? Or is it a quarter cup of ground coffee and then add five tablespoons of boiling water?Apologies for my coffee ignorance :)",
				"It's so delicious! I baked it as a cake and it came out a bit too dry because I kept it in the oven too long.But it's so delicious. Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hello, i made these for the first time and they are delicious! Do you have an idea of the calorie count?",
				"Made these yesterday with GF flour and topped with chopped almonds. Left them in the oven for a little longer than the recipe suggests as they were more undercooked instead of fudgy. Mine don't hold their shape that well once out of the cupcake liner but I didn't really notice as I was too busy stuffing them into my mouth! If you've got a chocolate craving these are delicious and really hit the spot!",
				"Ania have you tried monk fruit sugar sugar in these along with gf flour? Thanks",
				"I made these with GF flour mix and brazil nuts and they are SO GOOD. The best GF and vegan cake I've had in a long time and certainly the best I've made. I needed that today.",
				"I tried many vegan brownie recipes before, but they weren't good. My non-vegan family got convinced that you can't make good vegan brownies. But these brownies are proving them wrong. Absolutely delicious and really easy to make!",
				"Can I substitute castor sugar for  granulated sugar? And is it possible to do without the electric mixer?",
				"Hi ! I\u2019ve had a lot of disappointments with vegan baking lately so tried these without too many expectations, and they are amazing ! So tasty and th\u00e9 texture is insane ! Thanks for th\u00e9 recipe.Lucie (all the way from France :) xx",

				"These look amazing! Bought everything i need apart from olibe oil lol. Do yiu know if regular frying oil will be ok? Thanks!",
				"These did not work for me :( I followed the recipe but they just came out really thick and tasted like salt? I don't know what could have gone wrong.",
				"Hi Ania,Thank you very much for including the non-American measurements, I cannot tell how much time I have always spent calculating Fahrenheits to Celsius ! Not to mention the \"cups\" measurement that makes me nuts :D Most of my favourite vegan recipes are from the US so I  have to recalculate a lot of things for my European mind :DThank you for being so thoughtful about  followers from the rest of the world ;)Cheers,Szasza from Hungary :)",
				"So i made this with my 3yo... but I was totally distracted and didnt read the recipe properly. Realised after I started that I didnt have any chocolate!!! so I just added extra cocoa, extra coffee, I doubled the aquafaba and added a splash of milk to make the batter less dry... and SOMEHOW it worked out awesomely!!!Excited to try the \"real\" recipe soon !",
				"Any ideas as to what I could use to replace the coffee? I have an 8 year old son who really doesn't need the caffeine lol.",
				"I just made these and I\u2019m so disappointed, they\u2019re not fudgy at all, just like quite dense cake. They still taste great but I was so excited for the elusive fudgy brownie! I baked them for 11 mins - I think next time I\u2019ll try 9. Could you maybe explain what they should be like when they\u2019re ready to come out? Like, springy top/still wobbly/whatever it is! I\u2019ve been dairy and egg free all my life so I\u2019ve NEVER made a truly successful brownie, so I don\u2019t really know what to look for to tell that they\u2019re ready! Thank you!",
				"I used only half  a cup of sugar and  next time I will bake it for 9-10 mins. They were still good. thanks.",
				"Ok. I just saw it... The sugar part was ommited by my brain... About the oil, for some reason I thought that the \"egss\" were either \"chia eggs\" or \"aquafaba with oir\"... so I didn't quite get it... I'm sorry and thanks... I'm really new to this...",
				"Hi there! I just made these brownies, and they did turn out to have a nice flavor, but I'm not sure they're at their best.... You never say when the oil and sugar should go into the mixture, so I ended up putting them in when I noticed and the best way I could... I actually had to add more water because my mixture turned out to be so thick that I couldn't even mix it up correctly...",
				"Early this morning... The babies were asleep, husband and dog asleep, and I couldn't shake the chocolatey pictures out of my head. Chopped the chocolate, was afraid husband or at least my dojjo would wake up due to the noise. Ate the last little bit of chocolate instead of chopping, just to be safe. But no. Not a peep out of anyone. All fast asleep. These brownies were SO easy to make and taste delicious! I was going to make your chocolate cookies at first, but the fudgy brownies reeled me right in. So glad they did :) The house smells fantastic. Thank you for a wonderful recipe \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0a",
				"Hi, do you think I could substitute some of the sugar for pureed dates?",
				"Hello I have a dinner party and would like to prep these then bake them not too long before serving (ideally they would still be a little warm) if I put batter in the fridge for few hours (thinking 4) would it still work?",
				"Fab! Had to make these as soon as I saw them. Put them in slightly too small cases (\u2018cos i\u2019m Lazy!), but I like a bulging top \ud83d\ude09. I cooked them for a couple of minutes longer, as I felt they were too squidgy still. Turned out great. Thanks Lazycatkitchen! Bonus - I made too much espresso, so topped the rest with warm almond milk and enjoyed that while they cooked \ud83d\ude03",
				"Thank you for the recipe! I made these for charity coffee morning and they went down very well! Only comment I can make - they should be eaten same day because they were very nice and had a crispy top just after cooling down but overnight they lost the crispness. That didn't affect the taste though. Tagged you in Istagram. :)",

				"Oh...mygawd. This was amazing. Mine looked exactly the photo! And that never happens!For me, though, this took a long long time to make, mostly because I stayed true to the ingredient list and bought oranges so I could make the \"freshly squeezed orange juice.\"  I thought I only needed to squeeze enough for 3/4  cup--because of COURSE I didn't read the  entire ingredient list through--but it turned out to be 2 1/4 cups in total, and that was a lot of squeezing ;-)BUT - the result was fan-fan-tastic, and we had honestly never had a muffin that was so gorgeous (looks and taste). My husband ate four of them in less than 24 hours...I will definitely make this again, only maybe with really really good commercial orange just :-)",

				"Hi ,Your recipe looks so yummy.. I'm gonna try this weekend!",
				"Hi Ania,I made the cupcakes today. I halved the recipe. The taste was awesome but the cake was very heavy as I thought it should be light and fluffy because of the semolina. I used ready made apple pure and the chick peas water from the can. Could you please let me know where I went wrong?ThanksAnu",
				"Can I substitute the orange marmalade for orange juice.",
				"Ania, your recipes always look so amazing and really inspire me! Can`t wait to try this one out. Wish it had less sugar in it, though ... I`m trying to cut back, though I have a sweet tooth, so it`s hard! But if I don`t eat too many at once ...! Do you think I could use finely ground polenta instead of semolina, cos I have a slight wheat intolerance?Wendy",
				"Ania, thanks so much for checking that out for me and saving me a big disappointment! I`ll try it as it is, then experiment a bit, as you suggest.",
				"love these little cupcakes! especially the addition of semolina. it's one of those ingredients that i love to bake with, but rarely do! it always makes everything so moist and delicious."

However, I was quadrupling to make a large quantity. My question to Ania is, are you using drained tins of whole tomatoes? or are you also using the juice from the tin?  I just found that (even though I was quadrupling everything) that this produced far too much sauce.",

			"recipe": [
				"1. Heat up the oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper. Cut your pumpkin into evenly sized pieces and coat in a little olive oil. Bake for about 30 minutes \u2013 until soft and lightly caramelised. Alternatively, you can steam your pumpkin instead.",
				"2. Transfer pumpkin to a food processor (as opposed to the traditional hummus, a food processor works much better here than an upright blender). Add tahini, pressed garlic, salt, chilli, and lemon juice to taste. Whiz until smooth. If the paste is too thick, trickle in 1-2 tbsp of water to thin it out.",
				"3. Transfer the hummus onto a plate, smooth it with the back of a spoon. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil or chilli oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds and fresh herbs. Serve with toasted pita or sourdough bread and a selection of mezze dishes."

				"granted, my lebanese grandmother would turn in her grave if she heard me refer to this dip as hummus... regardless, it is absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this again!",
				"Great  recipe! This has become a staple since  I have so many pumpkins!!!",
				"Hey Ania, Oooooh cannot wait to try this! (I have tried so many awesome sweet recipes from your blog - this will be my first savoury woop woop)Also - I just wanted to share with you that I am Israeli and although we have absolutely adopted hummus as our national dish, here is Israel EVERYONE knows that good hummus, the real stuff, comes from the Arabic nations around us, and even within Israel, the best places to have hummus are the Arabic villages. In fact, a pretty popular concept for a day trip will revolve around planning to get to a hummus place in such a village, where the rest of the day trip is basically planned planned around that. We are such a nation off fatties hahaha If you ever visit Israel - be sure to go to these! They are wonderful!!!",
				"The dip was incredible, but are you able to freeze it",
				"This was east to make, a good use of leftover pumpkin and the best hummus I've ever made! Thanks.",
				"Hi - Can this dish be frozen and sill retain its texture?",
				"Hi! I'm looking forward to trying your recipe, but I'm a little confused. Where does the garlic go in? Thanks!",
				"Thanks!",
				"Just made this for a dinner party and everyone was in LOVE (& they all asked for the recipe, which I sent around :) An amazing alternative to classic hummus - I will be making many times again! Thanks for sharing.",
				"About to make this for the third time!! Love it...I use Long Island Cheese Pumpkin...find it , grow it, store it..it's amazing and works fab in this dip. It also is the go to choice for pie!",
				"So does that mean if using hulled should put 6tbsp? Sorry",
				"What does hulled tahini mean in the recipe? Thank you",
				"Just discovered your blog , love all the recipes! great site :)",
				"I love the look of this recipe as it combines some of my favourite things. I'm just a little confused by the tahini amounts which reads 5 tbsp / \u00bc cup + 1 tbsp tahini, hulled..... does that mean 6 tbsps of tahini? What does hulled referred to (I only know this term in reference to strawberries....) It is completely possible that I have misread this.... it has been known! Many thanks in advance.",
				"Looking forward to trying the pumpkin humus. Pumpkins are cheap and local at this time of the year.",
				"This sounds delicious! Thanks for sharing.",
				"This looks fantastic. I am a fan of pumpkin&squash. I love your pumpkin, spinach, and walnut spaghetti; I can't wait to try this hummus. I will be using butternut squash as pumpkin is not available here now. I think canned pumpkin would not give the dip that special something that roasting the squash adds. Keep these lovely recipes coming. Thank you Ania."

				"1. To prepare the stock, chuck all the broth ingredients into a large pot (with a lid) with 10 cups / 2\u00bd litres of water. To intensify the flavour, I charred fennel and onion (cut in half) on a griddle pan. I brushed cut side with a little oil before pressing it into the hot pan to achieve a nice caramelisation. This is an optional step, but I reckon it gives the broth an extra depth of flavour. Put the lid on and bring the stock to a gentle boil and then simmer for about 60 minutes. Once cooled, put the broth through a sieve squeezing all the goodness out of the cooked vegetables. Do not throw away kombu or dried mushrooms, just chop them into smaller pieces and set aside.",
				"2. Cut your tofu into equal size pieces. Place them in a shallow dish and marinate in some soy sauce (or tamari). After a few minutes, flip them to the other side to make sure it\u2019s seasoned evenly.",
				"3. Combine 2 tbsp of frying oil with 2 tsp of sesame oil and 2 tsp of soy sauce and brush sweet potato slices, mushrooms and broccoli with it. Heat up a griddle pan and cook vegetables on a hot griddle pan in batches. Alternatively, you could bake your sweet potato slices and broccoli in the oven and saut\u00e9 your mushrooms in a pan. If you go down that route, heat up your oven to 220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F, spread sweet potato and broccoli on a tray ensuring that individual pieces aren\u2019t touching each other and bake broccoli for about 10-15 mins and potatoes for 20 mins. To saut\u00e9 mushrooms, heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a small pan, chuck in sliced mushrooms and saut\u00e9 on a medium heat until soft and lightly caramelised. Season with soy sauce to taste.",
				"4. If frying tofu, remove it from the marinade and sprinkle with a little cornstarch. Fry in 1-2 tbsp of hot oil (I used peanut) until golden on both sides. Blot on a piece of kitchen towel. You could also bake it, in which case skip cornflour and spread marinated tofu on a paper-lined baking tray and bake it in a 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F oven for about 30-40 mins, flipping once half way through the baking.",
				"5. Cook your noodles almost al dente according to the instructions on the packet. It\u2019s worth undercooking them a touch as they when they get immersed in a steaming hot broth they\u2019ll soften a little more.",
				"6. Put the bowls into a warm oven to heat them up for serving.",
				"7. Start warming up the broth. Season it with soy sauce, miso, vinegar, mirin and a touch of raw garlic and a few extra slices of ginger. Warm it up gently, you want to serve it hot but do not let it come to boil.",
				"8. Place a cluster of noodles, a few bits of tofu, sweet potato, broccoli and mushrooms a bit of shredded kombu and dried mushrooms in each soup bowl. Pour hot soup on top. Garnish with sliced spring onions, sesame seeds and chilli oil if you like your vegan ramen spicy. Tuck in while it\u2019s nice and hot!"

Since you used soba you should change your title to avoid confusion. Loving your choice of ingredients. I love using frozen tofu that's been thawed and the whey has been pressed out. If you cook it with the broth it soaks up the flavour and has a gentler soya flavour.",

If pan-frying your tofu, sprinkle it lightly with cornflour/cornstarch and fry on a small amount of hot oil until browned on both sides. Blot it with a piece of paper towel after frying. Finally, pour marinade over the tofu to flavour it. If baking, immerse the tofu pieces in prepared marinade and set the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F.

Thanks again it was smooth and delicious. Anna",

Like polishing the silverware my hands won't agree to follow what my mind commands. That being said the recipe was lighter than any hummus I have made before and the lemon and garlic danced on the palate . I even served it with a curried lentil stew and found that a dollop of hummus stirred into the stew made the whole concoction silky smooth and the heat of the stew bloomed the garlic in an addictive way.  I follow along with Aquafaba Hits and Misses and I was happy to see the substitution of aquafaba for oil.Thank you as always for the time and care you put into your recipes.",

Now add stock or water (I tend to rinse my tins out with it to get all the tomato goodness out), add 1 tsp of salt and chilli and simmer (without a lid) on a low heat for about 45-60 minutes giving it a good stir every 10-15 minutes. You want the tomatoes to break down fully and the sauce to thicken so that it coats your pasta nicely.",

Season the sauce with sugar (to neutralise citric acid used to preserve the tomatoes), pepper and more salt if needed. You can also add a bit more olive oil if you want it to be richer.",

				"I think I\u2019ve made this recipe at least 10 times. It is my absolute go to when I want a yummy pasta sauce. It is so simple to make thank you!",
				"I have never left a review for a recipe before. One because I\u2019m lazy but more because I\u2019ve never been wowed. So today I wanted to leave a comment because I am so so so so glad I stumbled across your blog and decided to try your recipes. And I am absolutely mind- blown. Everything I\u2019ve tried so far is absolutely delicious (Thai green curry and the Malabar curry), and this one here was an utter winner with  my husband and I. I am so so happy because we\u2019re recently married and I\u2019ve just started my hand at this cooking healthy and tasty meals everyday (while trying to bring him to the vegetarian side as much as possible), so I am so happy with how it has turned out so far. So thank you, so much.Oh and as for the recipe - I didn\u2019t have olives or basil or walnuts. So I just made it with the garlic, salt, pepper, and chilli flakes. And I added two teaspoons  of Nuttelex (olive oil spread) towards the end - gave it this beautifully rich, buttery taste.",
				"Loved the recipe. Thanks for sharing and for the beautiful images.",
				"Thank you for recipe",
				"This recipe is to DIE for. Thank you so much. Convinced my meat eating boyfriend that vegan food can be delicious and BETTER than any animal product dish out there!! You have a new disciple!! Xx",
				"Where's the protein? I mean, there's not very much. Searching for suggestions. I guess lentils, fake cheese, TVP, things like that, but it amazes me how many vegans/vegetarians whose bodies are in much better shape than mine can coast by on low protein.",
				"This has become the new favourite for our family. Quick, easy and so so good! Sometimes I wonder how come I never thought before to add olives into the pasta sauce? We mixed fresh tomatoes with tomato sauce. Somehow our local market manages to supply really good Cretan tomatoes that have a smell and taste even in February-March (and they sell also really good quality GF pasta). Perfect lunch, when I don't really feel like thinking too much about what to cook. No fuss and everyone loves it!Great photography, as always! ;)",

If you want to bake your tofu instead, heat up the oven to 180\u00ba C / 360\u00ba F and spread tofu pieces on a baking tray.

				"5. Once you finish frying the tofu, wipe the wok with a piece of kitchen towel (be careful as it will be hot) to get rid of any cornflour residue. Pour another tablespoon of oil and add sliced white parts of spring onions (save green bits as garnish) and sliced chilli. Fry gently on medium heat until they both soften, for about 5 minutes.

Push the contents of the wok to the side (or set aside on a small plate) and pour in the sauce you prepared earlier and cornflour slurry (mix well before adding as cornflour will drop to the bottom). Mix the two together and let the sauce come to the boil gently. Let the sauce bubble gently for a minute or two so that it thickens a bit. Now incorporate softened spring onions, chilli, ginger and garlic mixture back into the sauce and add ground pepper to taste.",

				"This was so delicious! I didn't have any fresh chillis so instead went all out with three tsp of black pepper. I didn't find this amount at all overwhelming but then again I like spicy food. I chose to use baked tofu, the texture was really good and contrasted nicely with the stir-fried broccoli I included.",
				"I made this with mock beef. My boyfriend said it was so good he thought it was from a restaurant! I had rice vinegar and mirin at the house ans wasnt sure which one to use so I went with the mirin and the sauce tasted great.",
				"I have been making this recipe for about 3 years now and it's only just occurred to me to leave a comment! Sorry!I love this meal, it's one of my favourites. It's so healthy and low calorie but SO tasty, to me it feels like I'm eating a takeaway. My fianc\u00e9 loves it too, he's not as obsessed with tofu as I am but the way it's made in this recipe he can't get enough.I also share it with all my friends who are wanting to try vegan recipes as it's simple enough but will show them how tasty tofu can be. Thank you!",
				"Doubled the sauce because I added some veggies. Super spicy!!! Not sure where I went wrong :(. The flavor was great but it was too spicy to eat.",
				"LOVED THIS! Added shiitake mushrooms, some tender stem brocolli and it was amazing, so much better than a takeaway! Thank you, this up there with our favourite recipes now!",
				"Second time of making and it can\u2019t be beaten.",
				"I made this for dinner tonight and although I liked the way the tofu was crispy, it just seemed a little flat to us.  For starters, the amount of rice wine vinegar seemed overpow",
				"Have loved this for years and just found it again to make for my 18 month old. A favourite of mine. I stir fry some broccoli in Chinese five spice (straight from the dried spice jar) and feel crazy fancy.",
				"Just made this for dinner for me and my boyfriend and we both it was amazing! Will definitely be making this again, thanks!",
				"Hi! I'm really excited to make this recipe tonight! Would you recommend using dark or light soy sauce? Thanks!",
				"Love this recipe and cook it often - thanks! I always add aubergine to it which probes to be a tasty addition and makes it go a bit further.",
				"I made this because it seems to be just like the tofu they serve in SHUK (Warsaw) and omg it is! The only thing that didnt work out is that it wasn't as crispy as it should be and I'm not sure where I went wrong because it seemed crispy after the initial frying. Either way it was delicious!",

				"This looks and sounds delicious!I would like to bake instead of fry the tofu but I am confused when to add the l-2 tbsp of high smoke oil which is listed in the ingredients - \"l-2 tbsp if you bake your tofu\"Would you please clarify? Apologies if it is obvious \ud83d\ude1f",

				"This Black Pepper Tofu dish is delicious!  We are 1 week in on this vegan thing and we may stick with it thanks to dishes like this!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! As a side note, I swapped out the rice for rice noodles and left off the sesame seeds.  Additionally, I added a little veggie stock to the sauce to thin it out and provide a little more because we are saucy people.  ;)",
				"I just made this last night over some shirataki noodles, sauteed broccoli, sliced avocado, sliced cucumber, pickled ginger and wasabi......it's lit. Thanks for this, and also I had to add water to the sauce as well, but that's it. Thumbs up.",
				"just made this a few days ago and it was delicious! super easy (i've never ever cooked tofu before either!), and i love when a recipe calls for regular ingredients i already have on hand. non-vegan boyfriend loved it also, so i'll definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation. thanks for sharing- it was awesome! \u2718",
				"Oh my gosh. I just made this, ate it with lightly stirfried broccoli, snowpeas, carrot and more sesame seeds (wish I'd had some bok choy or wombok!) - and this is so good that I couldn't actually believe it. It's amazing. It's completely, deliciously perfect. I had to add just a weee bit of water to the sauce mix (it thickened a little too fast for me!). If anyone's thinking of trying this, do it. It blew my mind.",
				"Hi ,I have made Ottolenghi 's recipe for Blackpepper Tofu ,it is delicious but I used Food52 'S recipe version because it  uses much less butter. Your recipe seems less labour intensive! To have very firm tofu I freeze it first and then weigh it down with a cast iron frying pan, works really well.",
				"I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing!! I am still drooling just thinking about it.I added organic veggies from my garden and used leftover jasmine rice from another night. Really worked out perfectly and the flavor and texture of the tofu was just fabulous. Great recipe, thank you!",
				"Ah this sounds so good! I am going to make this for my little sis she eats tofu all the time!",
				"Absolutely delicious!!! Have never cooked tofu that tasted so good thanks to your method and the sauce was also divine. Thank you!",
				"I have a question: would you recommend doubling the sauce ingredients if I wanted to add some vegetables to the tofu (broccoli, green beans, peppers, and zucchini), or do you think there's plenty without doubling it? Thank you so much and I look forward to trying the recipe :)",
				"This recipe is so good! I don't usually eat tofu but this is gooooood! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04",
				"OHMYGOSH this is so good!!!!! Thanks for the recipe I loooooove it!",
				"Delicious recipe! Thank you! Big hit with everyone!",
				"This is delicious! It's going to be a regular around here. I replaced half of the tofu with red pepper and zucchini.",
				"I made this tonight with my Dad; we eat Black Pepper Chicken from our local Chinese Restaurant in our house all the time (I recently made the decision to transition to Vegetarian), and we all agree: THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER! We used ground ginger instead of grated, vegetable oil instead of peanut, soy sauce, brown sugar, and no sesame seeds. Will definitely be making this recipe again.We also let the oil heat up a little too long, so the tofu cooked a bit too quick. It didn't burn, luckily- it was our first time cooking with tofu, so we made sure to keep a close eye on it.",
				"Tried my first recipe from your site - Vegan black pepper tofu - it was very yummy! I added some water since the `sauce` soon disappeared. Felt it needed something else to eat with it, so served it with an Asian kale salad and some leftover stir fried vegetables. Went down very well with the family! By the way, I think there was a mistake in the recipe - step 6 repeated what I`d already done in step 4. Thanks for your great ideas - I love looking at them!",
				"Hi Ania,I thought it was a bit different originally, but haven`t got my printed out copy any more (wrote it into my recipe book by hand!). It all seems to be correct now, so either you`ve already corrected it or I need new glasses!Love, Wendy",
				"I've just finished eating this - it's lovely, I highly recommend it. My other-half even enjoyed it and he isn't normally keen on my chinese cooking attempts. I will definitely be eating this again. This is my first recipe from this site and after eating this I'm looking to see what I can cook for tea tomorrow from Lazy Cat Kitchen."

				"This recipe has become a family favorite. The flavors are amazing. We are fortunate to live in a place where we can get fresh coconut milk and that takes it to the next level!",
				"Delicious!",
				"Soo yummy  \ud83d\ude0b. \ud83d\udc4d",
				"Hi Ania - This is definitely my new 'go to' vegetarian curry recipe! I have made it with roasted pumpkin and also with roasted butternut squash - the pumpkin held its form better but both were tasty. The spices were a perfect blend , and while Premium coconut milk is always the richer flavour, it was still really good with reduced fat coconut milk. I like to add chickpeas and sometimes cauliflower. I use maple syrup every chance I get, but when I ran out, used brown sugar - yum to that! Served over brown basmati, with steamed baby bok choy.  So delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Oops, I don\u2019t think I hit the star rating when I submitted my comment. Definitely a 5/5!",
				"This was absolutely delicious! I think I could eat it every day and it will definitely be making a regular appearance in our  dinner rotation. The only change I made was to eliminate the tomatoes because I\u2019m allergic to them and  I \u201cheaped\u201d the spices except for the Chili powder. Thank you for sharing!",
				"Made this tonight and loved it. I used fresh squeezed coconut milk which really made it perfect. This is the first recipe of yours I\u2019ve tried. Now I\u2019ll be sure to try some of your others.",
				"I love this recipe. It has a great consistency, not too thick, not too runny. Great flavor, nice way to use any leftover pumpkin. I made a few changes to make it more kid friendly: omitted fresh chili, decreased hot chili powder to 1/8 of a teaspoon and used cardamom instead of mustard seeds (I didn't have mustard seeds at home and I love cardamom).",
				"My husband cooked this tonight after I sent him the recipe and it was DELICIOUS. Definitely a keeper! Thank you!",
				"We had been saving a Seminole pumpkin for a special dish and this was just the one to use it in! We made it last night (thankully a double batch) and took it over to my dad's and wife's for dinner.  We were all amazed at our good fortune! This was one of the best things I've ever made or eaten. I don't normally like to use so many superlatives, but they are necessary here! We didn't use any hot chilis, and left out the maple syrup, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We also made the spicy kale (without the spice) and it too, was fabulous and a perfect accompaniment to this dish. Thank you so much for sharing this! I can't wait to make more of your recipes!"

				"4. Take the potato matchsticks out of the water, rinse them and blot dry with a kitchen towel.",
				"5. Place dry potato matchsticks in a rectangular dish. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of oil and use your hands to ensure that all matchsticks have been coated in oil.",
				"6. Pre-heat the oven to 225\u00b0 C / 435\u00b0 F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
				"7. Using a small sieve sprinkle a thin amount of cornflour-spices mixture over the greased matchsticks. Make sure all sides are covered.",
				"8. Place potato matchsticks on the baking tray in a single layer and make sure fries do not touch each other as otherwise they will end up soggy. The more space they have around them the crispier they will turn out.",
				"9. Bake for about 30-35 minutes. 20 minutes in, gently turn the fries to the other side. If you have some small fries in between larger ones, they will be done sooner so you may want to take them out a bit earlier. Sprinkle with salt once done \u2013 adding salt to the spices and cornflour mixture stops the fries from crisping up.",
				"10. Combine all dip ingredients in a chopper or small blender and whiz until you get a thick dip. You may need to add a tablespoon or so of water to achieve the right consistency."

It will need a bit more water but it is very important to add the water in gradually, tablespoon by tablespoon. In my experience it takes another 1-2 tablespoons of water to make the correct consistency dough. Knead it for a few minutes with your hands and then set aside for 30 minutes under a clean kitchen towel or pierced (so that it can breathe) cling film so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.",
				"2. Heat up olive oil in a pan. Fry spring onions, garlic and ginger. Keep on stirring to make sure they don\u2019t burn. After 1 min, add in mashed butternut squash. Season with soy sauce, rice vinegar and chilli. Leave it to cool down. If you can, make the filling a day in advance as it gives all the flavours a chance to marry up and makes the filling taste better.",
				"3. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. You want it to be about 1-2 mm thin; the thinner the dough the tastier the dumplings. With an upside down glass, cut out circles in the dough. Place a heaped teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of each circle and seal the dough over the filling at the top. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely.Put the finished dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.",
				"4. Heat up a little peanut oil in a lidded frying pan. Once the oil is hot, place as many potstickers as you can on the pan without them touching each other. Fry for 2 minutes, then add a splash of water to the pan (1 cm) and put the lid on. Let the dumplings cook in their own steam for about 6-8 minutes \u2013 depending on how thin your dough is. Once all the water has cooked out, take the lid off and leave the potstickers on heat for another minute or two so that the bottom is nice and crispy.",

				"1. Juice the beetroot if you own a juicer. If you don\u2019t have a juicer grate it coarsely, place it in the middle of a muslin cloth and squeeze all the juice out of it. It should yield about 3 tsp of juice, which is plenty for giving your meringue\u00a0kisses\u00a0lovely festive colour.",

In a large, clean bowl (make sure there is no greasy residue, it is best to use a glass bowl for this) beat chickpea water with an electric whisk or use a stand mixer until you get stiff peaks. You may want to add \u00bd tsp of vinegar to stabilise the mixture but it isn\u2019t absolutely necessary \u2013 you can make beautiful meringues without it.",

				"5. Start adding sugar very slowly, tablespoon by tablespoon, whipping well after each addition. Continue until all the sugar has been added. By now, the mixture should become beautifully glossy, thick and sticky \u2013 no different to an egg-based meringue, really.",
				"6. Pre-heat the oven to 100\u00ba C / 210\u00ba F.",
				"7. Take a clean ziplock / sandwich bag and trickle \u00bd tsp\u00a0of beetroot juice inside making sure it coats the insides of the bag and doesn\u2019t gather at the bottom. Now spoon meringue mixture into the bag \u2013 you may want to lay the bag on its side for this so that the beetroot juice doesn\u2019t all run to the corner\u00a0of the bag.",
				"8. Cut the corner of your filled bag off \u2013\u00a0start with a small hole and make it larger if needed.\u00a0Hold the bag perpendicular to the tray and squeeze small blobs of the mixture onto the tray and quickly pull away after each blob. Allow some space around each blob or else the drops may stick together.",
				"9. Bake for about 75 minutes, then turn the oven off but leave the tray with meringue drops inside with the oven\u2019s door slightly open for another 45-60 minutes for the meringues to dry out fully. Keep the\u00a0meringues in an airtight container. Please note that the exact baking time depends on the size of your meringues so if you are going for a larger size, be sure to adjust baking time."

If you have a muslin cloth, put potatoes in the middle of a cloth and squeeze as much water out of them as you can \u2013 the drier the mixture the crispier your latkes will be. If you don\u2019t have a muslin cloth, use your hands to get rid of excess water.",
						"2. In a large bowl, combine finely chopped onions, grated potatoes, mustard, pepper, aquafaba (if using) and enough flour to make the mixture bind together. Do not add salt until you are ready to form latkes as salt will make potato mixture weep and the mixture needs to stay dry for as long as possible.",

Once the oil is hot, place a slightly heaped tablespoon of the potato mixture on the oil and flatten it with a back of your spoon. Fry on one side for a few minutes \u2013 do not flip the latkes over until they are browned all over on one side \u2013 you\u2019ll notice the edges will turn brown, that\u2019s the time to flip. Flip them to the other side using a flat spatula. Fry until the other side turns golden brown. Remove from the pan and place on a plate lined with kitchen roll to soak away excess oil. Put ready latkes in a warm (100\u00ba C / 210\u00ba F) oven while you fry subsequent batches.",
						"4. METHOD 2: Set the oven to 200\u00ba C / 390\u00ba F. Brush a baking tray with a little oil. Form latkes on the oiled tray, brush them with oil and bake for 10 minutes, then flip for another 10 and finally crank up the oven to 225\u00ba C / 435\u00ba F to brown the latkes for 5-10 minutes on both sides.",

				"1. Slice your aubergine lengthwise, into thin (0.5 cm / 1/8\u2033) slices. Sprinkle them generously with salt and set aside for an hour or two. This is meant to get rid of the bitterness that some aubergines have. Apparently, these days bitterness is not that common (as farming techniques have changed) so you may be able to skip this step, but do that at your own peril:).",
				"2. Heat up 1 tbsp olive oil in a small frying pan. Add chopped shallots and garlic and fry them, stirring regularly, until shallots are translucent and garlic is soft.",
				"3. Shred your chickpeas finely in a food processor. After 10 mins, take sundried tomatoes out of the soaking water, squeeze out the excess moisture and chop them into a very small dice.",
				"4. Rinse the aubergine slices very thoroughly to get rid of excess salt and then chop them into a very fine dice. Heat up 1 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and fry them gently until they are cooked.",
				"5. In a large mixing bowl, combine chickpeas, aubergine, sun-dried tomatoes (if using), shallots, garlic, walnuts, chilli, dried and fresh herbs, lemon juice and zest. Season with a good grind of black pepper. If you salted your aubergines, there is no need to add any more salt as there is always some residue salt left on them. If you did not salt the aubergines, season with salt to taste.",
				"6. Using your hands combine all the ingredients thoroughly so that they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Now add aquafaba and rice flour and mix again. If not using sun-dried tomatoes (which bind the mixture a bit more), you may need to increase the amount of aquafaba and rice flour a little bit. Once mixed, set aside for an hour or so for the mixture to bind better.",
				"7. Before you are ready to make your meat balls, heat up your oven to 175\u00ba C / 350\u00ba F and line a baking tray with a piece of baking paper.",
				"8. Using your hands, shape small amounts of mixture (I used 20 g for each meatball) into balls. You should get 20 meatballs out of this recipe. I studded the outside of the meatballs with a few pine nuts when shaping them so that they look nicer \u2013 you can totally skip this step (I know, pine nuts cost a small fortune).",
				"9. Brush each meatball with a small amount of olive oil and spread them on a baking tray. Bake for 15 mins, then turn over and continue baking for another 15 minutes. You could also pan-fry them if you prefer, but handle them with care."

Place the bowl full of melted chocolate in another bowl full of cold water with a few ice cubes in it. Take the bowl out of the cold water slightly before it reaches the desired temperature 81\u00b0 F / 27\u00b0 C as the temperature will continue to drop.",

						"1. Put a whole potato into a 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F oven and roast it until soft, it takes about 1 hour (depending on size). Let it cool down, peel it and mash the flesh up with a fork.",
						"2. Rinse your soaked chickpeas and grind them finely (they should resemble medium bulgur wheat after grinding) in a food processor.",
						"3. In a large bowl, combine mashed potato, ground chickpeas, chickpea flour, garlic, herbs and spices. Mix it all very thoroughly and place in the fridge for several hours (or freezer for an hour) to firm up.",
						"4. Put sesame seeds on a plate. Using your hands, form small falafels out of the mixture. Mine were 30 g each. The mixture will be fairly wet (that\u2019s good, it means that falafels won\u2019t end up dry after baking) so handle it carefully. Once shaped, dip your hand in sesame seeds and press them into the falafel with your fingers. Do that several times until the falafel is nicely coated on all sides.",
						"5. Pre-heat the oven to 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F. Brush a bit of olive oil onto a baking tray and place falafels on it, making sure they do not touch. Bake for 15-20 minutes on one side, then using a spatula flip onto the other side and bake for another 15-20 minutes. They are done when the exterior is crispy and golden."

				"I\u2019ve been using this recipes for years and keep coming back to it as it\u2019s so good! Super tasty falafels with a zingy sauce - perfection!",
				"Hi AniaI was hoping to make some of your regular fafels and noted you do these lovely baked versions, do you think I could substitute the sweet potato for butternut squash instead, as we are in lockdown I'm trying hard to use up all the food  that I have rather than going out to often . I hope you and your family are feeling better \ud83d\ude0aMany thanks jo",
				"Hi!  I have a question for you:  I just made the mixture and it is really delicious .  I'm catering a Christmas party on Saturday night and needed some vegan options so I was planning on making up the little patties today, then freezing them to be able to bake them off from a frozen state at the party on Saturday night.  But I was wondering if it might be better to form them, bake them off today, THEN freeze them and simply warm them in the oven at the party.  Do you have any experience one way or the other with making these ahead and freezing them?  I'm grateful for any insight you would care to share!  And thank you for a really delicious recipe - I've scoured the internet for something like this and have made several other iterations of sweet potato falafel but nothing comes close to being as good as yours!  Your weights, measurements and instructive video are also on point!",
				"Do you think I could replace the 1/4 cup chickpea flour with either buckwheat flour or oat flour? Cheers, Chee",
				"Dinner tonight.....so good!!!! I made your falafel and put it in a quinoa bowl with fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions. I made a jalapeno ranch dressing I found another blog and used that as my sauce. I will definitely be making these again :)",
				"Hi,Can I ground raw dry chickpeas instead of buying gram flour?Also, are they kid friendly, or too spicy due to the paprika and chilli?Thanks!Charlotte",
				"This recipe was absolutely brilliant! All the flavours (and more!) of a falafel without that usual dryness or added fat as they\u2019re baked not fried! I didn\u2019t coat them in any seeds and they were still amazing. Great hot or cold and if you make them into bigger patty shapes they make great burgers! Just wonderful \ud83d\ude0a",
				"Hi, Just curious as to whether you boil the chickpeas after soaking, or just go straight I'm with the  grind?Also have these been tried to freeze? Cheers, Ellie",
				"I\u2019ve made these a number of times now and they\u2019re delicious. Always go done a treat. I\u2019ve done with gluten free flour instead of chickpea flour as I couldn\u2019t get any and they\u2019 work out perfectly!!",
				"Hi Ania,I've not managed to try these yet as I have everything I'm just waiting for my oven to preheat.I think maybe the time taken is a bit misleading, whereas I will accept the chickpeas may need to be soaked overnight (or bought pre soaked) there is still an hour for your potato, followed by half an hour of cooking.I'm looking forwards to trying them and think the feedback above is a great reference for how these will turn out.Dave",
				"Thank you for the recipe! These look amazing!! :)",
				"Hi Ania, I have just found your blog and it looks amazing! Can't wait to try your recipes but starting with these falafels; if I wanted to make them in advance at what stage is best to freeze, before or after baking in the oven? Many thanksAnnika",
				"I made these falafels for my boyfriend yesterday and we loved them! It was the first time we had sweet potato falafel, but it will definitely not be the last time. They were full of flavour and really easy to make. Great recipe!Instead of baking the sweet potato, I steamed  it (as that was way quicker).",
				"Would it work if I sprouted and cooked the chickpeas before making the patties? Thanks",
				"Hello Ania,I love your ideas and style!I did not have sweet potato at home so I had to improvise. I was thinking to add a pinch of fructose instead (I do not consume other sugars), but I relied entirely on the sweetness of the chickpeas. What I did though is mimic the sweet potato consistency by taking 1/3 of the mixture and making it into a humus like consistency. I baked the falafels without the potato (and without the garlic). They still turned out extremely tasty. I cooked with slightly pre-boilled chickpeas. I used dill for the tahini sauce and it happens to be a good mix.I got the huge quantity of chickpeas as a result from experimenting with aquafaba. I am miserably failing with all aquafaba recipes, I am guessing that it is because I have to replace sugar with fructose and they do not act the same in heat and with protein. I am not giving up yet, but it is a challenge.Thank you for the great work and beautiful videos!",
				"Can I use almond  meal instead  of seseme seeds?  What do you suggest?",
				"I have to say this is the best recipe ever, I've make it on a weekly basis! The first time I saw it I immediately doubled the quantities because I knew I would love the flavours and I was not wrong! Last Monday I accidentally quadrupled the recipe (soaked 2 c dried chickpeas, whoops) and was able to bake them only yesterday but I'm not really worried as we've eaten half already and there is always the freezer option. I might add that this recipe was a huge deciding factor if I should get a food processor - and now I have one :)  you've become my go-to vegan blog Ania and Duncan! :)Looking forward to trying the Moroccan meat balls next :)PS: do you have any gf bread recipes up your sleeves by any chance...?",
				"Aww! I'm glad I made your day :) Your blog definitely contributes greatly to my vegan low-fat cooking (emphasis on the low-fat though!) and makes eating plants super tasty even for my n\u0336o\u0336n\u0336 soon-to-be vegan boyfriend ;) Hope Duncan's run went wellBasia",
				"Thank you - He's a work in progress! Your pictures are always very well-photographed but do I know how much work it takes to get them right and edit them [enclosing link to my website]Basia",
				"Hi Ania,This is a wonderful recipe! Thank you! I'm planning on making this in a large quantity for a party. I think I would have to do it 2 days in advance. Do you have any tips on storing?Best,Neela",
				"These were absolutely delicious, my husband said they were the best falafels he's had.I used a tin of cooked chickpeas as I didn't realise you were supposed to soak overnight. They still came good and I'll be making them again, thanks for the great recipe!",
				"Thank everything looks so delicious I don't know where to start.  Great of us veggies/vegans.",
				"yum!! can you sub in regular or whole wheat flour for the chickpea flour?",
				"I used whole wheat flour (as I didn't have any other flour in my home) and they turned out perfect.",
				"Looks great! Could you give the amount of chickpeas post-soaking too? I have soaked a large amount to use in general, and I am a bit lost now -- is it 1 1/4 cups of soaked chickpeas that I need? Thanks!",
				"Perfect, thanks for the clarification, they turned out beautifully!",
				"Cous Couse is not a grain it is a pasta by the way.  However, they are delicious.  That unexpected sweetness in a falafel is really different and delicious.  Thanks.",
				"Oh man these look so amazing!! I love that they're studded with sesame seeds, that's such a nice touch :)"

				"I've been making this bread for a long time now adding various toppings including chilli flakes, nigella seeds, garlic granules and mustard seeds. It has become a regular in our house between baking everyday loaves and tiger bread. Thank you for sharing the recipe.",
				"Well it definitely took alot longer than than I was expected..it would have been nice for you to put that prep time includes the hours it takes for yeast to rise for those who have never used it before.... Cause it took ALOT LONGER than 20 min to prepare to cook it...allowing the yeast to do its thing is part of the prep time so In my opinion this isn't as advertised at all.. Nothing beats homemade bread though",
				"OMG this was faboulous And oh so easy!  I might make it every day.  We had tried a Turkish bread for the first time 2 days before from Sultan's Middle Eastern Market in Tampa and loved it.  Since I had citric acid and the market brand contained it, I added a 1/4 teaspoon.  I assume it would help it last longer.  I will not know as this will be gone tonight!",

I was accidently on the wrong setting on the oven. :-( Luckily I turned out before it started getting too burn.  It was still delicious and amazed how easy it is.  Thanks again.",

We bought way too many of these, and were always heartbroken when they had none left. Looking forward to  making (and devouring) this on the weekend.",
				"The oven surely goes pretty high and is adequate size to make one bread at a time of say 9\" diameter.  Oven can one go higher than 250 celcius easily. I would make it one of these days. It should taste very nice with some Korma or other complex Indian curries. Many foods from turkey to middle east to central asia to afghanistan pakistan and northern India are modifications of similar recipes. The similarities are the norm as are subtle variations. Thanks for your response. I am just learning to bake though, but I am an expert on curries!",

Its a stone oven heating at top and bottom with 600 watt elements on both top and bottom and goes up to 380/390 deg celcius or 725 deg F. This Pide ramazan bread recipe is very interesting and  I want to try baking itin my Pizza oven. The oven has a basic thermostat  to control temperature but  does not have a thermometer so to say to give exact temperature for baking. Having said that I can measure temperature on the stone using a IR thermometer.My question is can such a bread be done at higher temperature. How sensitive is final product to temperature. Higher temperature is an advantage or a disadvantage for such bread.The oven  can be opened to see the appearance of the bread and assess its doneness.....experience can eventually allow such a nice bread to be made proficiently but should my starting point be a slow bake at low or fast bake at high/higher.",
				"Great recipe! Nice and easy with very tasty results. I hunted down some nigella seeds (\u00e7\u00f6rek otu) to use along with the sesame seeds on top, which adds to the flavour I love most about the is bread.",
				"I regularly visit a Turkish shop about a mile from home and love their bread so I had a go at making this. It turned out reasonably well but it was a little dense. I used  bread flour, perhaps I could try just plain flour? I will also check my yeast to see if its actually instant. I dont think the water used was warm either.. Anyway looking forward to having another go soon.Also when is guacamole not guacamole?  When it's a salad!  I tried to make some recently and waited until everything else was done before splitting my avocados. They were rotten! So plan B, I added a tin of tuna and ot was awesome!",
				"I am not sure what I did wrong but my bread came out dense and didn't rise much.  I followed measurements exactly for flour and water but I had a rather dry dough, not wet at all.  I did add little more water and let it rise for the time itt said.  Any tips so I can be successful next time?Thanks for any tips.Nosheen",

				"A little update - when I made this bread originally I wasn't looking for a \"vegan\" bread but rather an easy & delicious Turkish bread recipe in which this absolutely is. I had mentioned that I even used the same recipe to make pizza dough which the kids (and neighborhood kids) loved as well. For the new year I am trying a 30 day Vegan cleanse and I can't wait to try more of your recipes. I watched \"what the health\" on Netflix and it was really mind blowing.

This year due to Covid - we were unable to go to any mosque during Ramadan. I know how to make Turkish lentil soup and Yayla (yogurt/mint/rice) soup. But when I make it I have to make a special trip to Brooklyn to get Turkish bread (or else my daughter won\u2019t eat the soup). Well - this recipe CHANGED EVERYTHING! I spent months afraid to attempt it as I can\u2019t even master Pita bread. Yesterday I said well - it\u2019s vegetarian night so let\u2019s try.  I was skeptical as I only have regular flour in hand as well. OMG! It came out wonderful. I made 2 loaves and the bread was gone and no one even finished their soup! We also served olives in a garlic/olive oil/oregano/basil mixture and the kids dipped the bread in it - just like when we go to our favorite Turkish restaurant in Brooklyn (Istanbul).  It was so good that I made another batch today and used the same recipe as my homemade pizza base (just added sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil and halal pepperoni). KIDS LOVED IT!!! Thank you! Thank you! I shared the recipe with my sister as well since one of  her kids is vegan."

Repeat a few times until paper towel stays almost dry.",
				"2. Once tofu has been pressed, cut the block in half to end up with two 50% thinner blocks. Cut each block into 12 even pieces. Pour some soy sauce into a large, shallow bowl and tip all tofu cubes into it. Pour enough soy sauce to at least half-immerse the tofu. Leave it to marinate for 30 mins, then flip the tofu pieces over and keep in soy sauce for another 30 mins.",

				"5. Pour 1 cm of oil into a small frying pan and heat it up slowly (on low-medium heat). To test it, drop a few breadcrumbs in. If the oil sizzles when the breadcrumbs hit its surface it is ready for frying. Alternatively, you can measure the oil\u2019s temperature \u2013 it should reach about 175\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Pop a few tofu pieces into the oil but do not overcrowd the pan. Fry them on each side for about 2-3 minutes (until that side turns nicely golden) and then turn them over using BBQ tongs. Once the\u00a0first\u00a0batch is ready, spread the tofu on a piece of paper towel to blot excess fat and start frying another batch. Continue until you\u2019ve fried all the tofu. Enjoy straight away with a side of sweet chilli sauce."

				"Made these today & they are perfect! I couldn\u2019t stop eating them \ud83d\ude01  I didn\u2019t have any walnuts so used pecans instead. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",
				"These are so lovely! I agree with another commenter that they remind me of halvah, which I love. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe :)",
				"These look delicious!! Is there any substitute for tahini that I can use?",
				"Made these tonight and they were so good! I was hesitant-- I thought they'd be more of a savory cookie or at least a less sweet \"tea\" cookie but they were surprisingly sweet (not too much) and good! The maple syrup was just the right amount. I did add the sesame seeds and I loved them that way. You can easily leave that off and it'd be great. I used the ground oats as the flour option. I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I love this recipe and have now used it twice! It's so quick and easy. The cookies taste yummy and healthy. I use ground almond (same quanitty) instead of walnuts because I can't blend up nuts to a flour and it works perfectly. I also cooked them without the sesame seed coating - and they are still good. My non-vegan friends love them just as much as me. Perfect :)",
				"Hi:) Great recipe! Can we skip the fridge part before putting in the oven, if we don\u2019t have that much time?",
				"Thank you Ania! I'll give the sunflower seeds a go.",
				"I'd love to make these for my daughter's lunchbox, but they don't allow any nuts at school. What could I use instead of the ground walnuts?",
				"hi, I love these cookies! Fridge is helping sesame seeds to stick? I skipped fridge, and seeds are separated now :(",
				"Wow! These are sooo delicious!! They have the perfect amount of sweetness and slightly chewy texture! My husband said it\u2019s like a mix between a cookie and halva(and we sure love halva). I didn\u2019t have walnuts on hand, but had pecan nut instead. I can\u2019t wait to try these with walnuts next time! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Hi I am Emanta from The Netherlands and  against my autoimmune diseases I am on a vegan diet without gluten, lactose, sugar, chocolate. Do you have recipes for me too?Thanks so much. Kind regards, Emanta",
				"Thanks so much for this recipe!  I\u2019m making it for the second time right now.  This time I\u2019m using half spelt flour and half white and they taste very similar, atleast as good as the first batch, which everyone loved.  They are not too sweet and I feel good about giving them to my toddler as a nice source of iron and calcium.  They remind us of the sesame biscuits we often ate for breakfast in China when we lived there some years ago.  Yum:)",
				"I changed a few things. I used brown rice flour and instead of the sweeteners you used, I used 100% dates so there was a measurement discrepancy on multiple levels to make them strictly whole food, plant based but omg!! First time I ever have managed to make a crunchy biscuit since turning plant based! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Also, I've been struggling to gain weight but I have a feeling that's about to change. Haha! Thanks again.P. S. Tahini is a gift from the gods!",
				"Thanks a lot.",
				"Thanks very much for your great recipes.can I cut out this cookies with a cutter?",
				"These are SO GOOD! Not too sweet, super dunk-able in a cup of coffee, and so easy to make! The reviews were positive, but they are sincerely delicious! Love and will be making again!",
				"What an awesome recipe Ania!  I made these tonight with a couple of substitutions- honey and GF Flour.  Ve",
				"I was intrigued when this recipe popped up on Pinterest.  Made them this afternoon and will definitely make them again!  I used dark buckwheat flour and am eager to try them with different food such as sorghum and fisted chickpea flour (which should be delicious!)",
				"These biscuits are delicious, I have made them about three times now, they are so tasty with a soy cappucino. The biscuits look so good, when they have been baked too",
				"These were truly incredible; even my bestie who isn't normally a fan of \"healthy alternatives\" thought they were amazing! I used almond flour instead of all purpose and just doubled the baking soda, and I mixed some cacao nibs through as well. They had a lil bit of crunch on the outside and were deliciously soft on the inside. Thanks so much for this recipe!",
				"Is the maple syrup necessary for the texture, or just sweetness? Can it be left out without affecting the texture? I don't have any on hand... perhaps a granulated sweetener like stevia or coconut sugar would work?",
				"Hi Ania, these sound delicious. I want to 'bake ahead' for a party. How long do the cookies keep?",
				"Does whizzed mean you put it in the food proccesor?",
				"I completely glossed over the instruction that said the refrigerate first! Woops... But, I must say, the cookies still turned out delicious! I think they puffed up more in the oven than they would have had they been refrigerated, but that's okay with me! I also cooked them more around 15 minutes, and used gf flour and almond flour as I had no  walnuts on hand. Will certainly make them again, hopefully with the right ingredients and steps next time, haha.",
				"This just came up on my Facebook feed today. We are planning on making these this afternoon with my daughter and her husband. I am so looking forward to this!",
				"I made your cookies, and they were just delicious. The only thing I added was a light spread of honey glaze on each cookie after they had completely cooled and another generous sprinkle of lightly roasted sesame seeds over each. For some reason, I rarely find a vegan cookie recipe I want to make over and over again, but this one I definitely will. Thank you!",
				"Thank you so much for this recipe! Didn't have quite enough maple syrup so substituted one of the tablespoons for one of honey, but the cookies came out well and had a lovely flavour. I also love the sesame seeds on top - so pretty!",
				"hi there! these cookies look awesome, but I have no  whizzed walnuts, can I use  whizzed hazelnuts instead?",
				"Hi.  I was  wondering if you w ould be able to provide conversion of cookie ingreadients  to  cups...thank you!",
				"great recipe Ania! tahini is one of my favourite \"undiscovered\" ingredients ( I love it stirred through a tomato based sauce - try it!)just a quiet word of advice though in regard to oat flour. it actually isn't gluten free ;-)",
				"Oh my! Finally a healthy cookies recipe that really works! Thanks for sharing this Ania! They are so good and easy to make. Even with my terrible oven they turn out just great!",
				"OMG, I am not usually a big fan of tahini but I thought those cookies looked so pretty, healthy and easy to make that I decided to give them a try.... Thanks godness I did, those are DELICIOUS. I am in love. Thanks for the recipe. x",
				"Best cookies ever!!! I love sesame and walnuts - both make an unbeatable taste combination for these cookies. Warning: you won't be able to eat just one :) Bonus: it's a calcium rich whole foods \"unguilty\" pleasure",
				"I just made these yesterday.  These are definitely going to be this years holiday cookies i give away to friends and family. They reminded me so much of the sesame cookies my Italian great-grandmother would make. One bite and they took me right back to her kitchen in Brooklyn. Great recipe!",
				"I'm so glad I found your blog!! These cookies (and all your other recipes) look absolutely amazing! :)",
				"I'm a huge sesame seed and tahini lover so this recipe is perfect for me. Thanks for sharing :)",
				"The first thing I thought of when I saw the tahini cookie headline was the \"benne seed\" cookies popular in Charleston, South Carolina (USA).  Those are a crispy wafer/cookie though.  But benne seeds are sesame seeds, so I'm wondering how the flavor of this will compare.  I'll have to make it and see! :)"

				"A few minutes ago for lunch, I ate a sandwich inspired by this.. I was going for this sandwich, but never got around to cutting and grilling the eggplant last night, and the store was out of zucchini when I went, so I got summer squash instead.  I also grilled up one red, one orange, and one yellow pepper, so I had one slice of red and one of yellow on my sandwich today.  I also added portobello mushroom slices (also grilled).  I was going to add fresh tomato, but I forgot to slice it before assembling my sandwich this morning, and didn't feel like taking the sandwich apart and adding once the sandwich had actually gotten kind of together in my lunchbox.Oh, shoot, I also just realized I forgot to pick some basil for it... that would have been good.I also made the tapenade with some kalamata, some \"natural\" green olives, and a little bit of marinated artichokes (and capers). But other than being completely different, it was totally this sandwich.  and it was delicious.  I might actually grill up the eggplant tonight, and add it to future sandwiches, since I still have plenty more of the other veggies."

				"Love this recipe. My girlfriend and I live in Austin and we\u2019re looking to recreate a black olive tapenade from our favorite sandwich shop (RIP Fricano\u2019s). Went out on a limb and invested $50 for a mini food processor just to make this and it was TOTALLY worth it, even better than the one we were trying to recreate. Thanks a bunch, Ania!",
				"It definitely should! Will make it with capers when I have them :)  next up are your vegan cinnamon rolls!",
				"Delicious! Thanks so much for your wonderful recipe. I made it with a mix of green & black olives (what I had in the fridge), sun dried tomatoes in oil instead of the capers and then added a couple of small  cornichon pickles to add a bit of the  briney sourness. It was so tasty that I aimmediately ate 5 spoonfuls with crostini! So much better than what\u2019s sold in the shops. Thank you! Mary xx",
				"Can I make the tapenade without nuts since I'm allergic?",
				"I make mine with walnuts not almonds. The extra earthiness seems to work very well. I use almonds when I make green tapenade.",
				"Do you use olives in oil or water?Thanks",
				"This looks great? How long does it keep for in the fridge?",
				"oooh, this looks awesome!  I have (found online) an artichoke olive tapenade recipe that I love to make for potlucks and stuff.  I leave it a little chunky and serve with crackers or chips or bread rounds like a dip.  This looks like a great variation, I'll have to try it soon!"

If you find it too dry, add another 10 ml of coffee (or water), but do it gradually so that you only add as little moisture as necessary.",
				"8. Spread the brownie \u2018dough\u2019 in the lined tray, pressing it down well and into the corners. Make sure the base layer is even. Pop it into the freezer to set.",
				"9. Clean your food processor. Put 150 ml of date paste back into the food processor with almond butter and \u00bd tsp of salt (you can add more to taste). Add 1 tbsp of water to make it more spreadable. You can also add 1 tbsp of coconut oil if you want the top to be a bit less tacky after it has set, but that\u2019s absolutely not necessary. Process until you get a smooth, spreadable salted caramel.",
				"10. Take the base layer out of the freezer and spread salted caramel on top. Sprinkle with chopped almonds if you wish. Put into a freezer for 2 hours before cutting."

				"I am not vegan , but I have been really conscious of what I eat and have  not been eating any refined sugar for a good amount of time now. My family doesn\u2019t though so when I made these for Easter they were very skeptical wether these would actually be good, because they said they weren\u2019t proper brownies and just a bite of healthy \u201ejoylessness\u201c. BUT once they had tried them , they were very pleasantly surprised, my father said they had the perfect consistency and everything! Of course they aren\u2019t true brownies he said , but he thinks it is a great alternative for a healthy lifestyle! I love them , and after not having anything proper sweet like this in a few months , I really enjoyed them! Definitely recommend and after stopped having anything with sugar etc. for a few months these seemed to be the perfect replacement if not BETTER for a little treat now and then. Thank you!",

This is my favorite brioche recipe but I made it for Christmas morning so I wanted to change it up and make little chocolate and orange buns for tomorrow morning.Happy New Year to you both!Verena",
				"Made it yesterday and we managed to eat half of it at once (it was humongous)! Really delicious, fluffy and great texture. Chocolate and walnuts is such a great combo. I used a mixer with a kneading hook to make the dough and gave it a few 'hand kneads' at the end just to check if it was ready. I added 'NO Egg' egg replacer, cardamom and melted vegan butter to the dough. Didn't have any strong flour and used all purpose instead. Also i used vegan Nutella for the filling. This is my best attempt with vegan sweet bread so far! I tried some recipes with pumpkin puree and whipped aquafaba but the texture wasn't nearly as good. Even my partner who doesn't care about food in general (unlucky me) was absolutely sold on this challah! Thank you!",

I also used only 90g of walnuts (that was all I had in the kitchen) and it was the perfect amount for me. Will definitely make it again!",
				"This looks fab! BTW, I just joined your mailing list on the promise of a Sweets e-book, but none arrived. Can you tell me where I can get it?Thanks",

				"Can I use cocoa powder instead of chocolate bars?",

It turned out beautifully :) I look forward to my husband's reaction tomorrow when he tries it.

What is the difference between strong and all-purpose flour? Here in Denmark I can buy either white or whole wheat flour.Thanks!",

Wrap cling film tightly around the bowl \u2013 you can also use a plastic bag. The point is to let the hot peppers sweat for a few minutes as this way their skin will come off much more easily.",
				"4. After about 15 mins, tear the cling film open and let the peppers cool down so that you don\u2019t burn your fingers. Once the peppers are cool enough, take the skin off \u2013 the best way to do that is to start from the pointy bit of each pepper.",
				"5. Chuck roasted walnuts into a food processor and process until you have a coarse meal. Add in peppers, chilli flakes, \u00bd tsp of salt, garlic, cumin, pomegranate molasses, tomato paste and process. Make sure you close the chute as this dip is runnier than hummus and can attempt an escape:). If you want a thicker dip and are not worried about gluten, add breadcrumbs to thicken it up.",
				"6. Transfer the dip to a small plate and pour a bit of olive oil on top to stop it from drying out and to give it an extra shine. Enjoy with toasted pita bread, other mezze-style dishes and salads."

						"\u00bd tsp lemon/lime juice or apple cider vinegar",

			"serving": "makes 4 portions",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Chop or break the chocolate into smaller chunks and place it in a glass or metal bowl. Place the bowl over the water bath and allow the chocolate to heat up very SLOWLY and make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl (that\u2019s important as chocolate is very sensitive to high temperatures). Once the the water barely just starts to simmer, switch the heat off. Once chocolate looks melted, give it a gentle stir (dark chocolate is sensitive to overstirring). Take the bowl off the heat and allow the chocolate to cool down \u2013 you want it as cool as possible but still liquid.",
				"2. Open your tin of chickpeas and drain the chickpea water into large glass bowl. Aquafaba should not be cold as it will make chocolate seize when added. The bowl and the utensils you\u2019ll use to whip aquafaba need to be completely grease-free as even the tiniest grease residue can prevent aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks.",
				"3. Add acid (neutral vinegar, lemon or lime juice) to the chickpea water to stablise the aquafaba. If using aquafaba from homecooked chickpeas, I also like to add a small pinch of salt \u2013 it helps to reach stiff peaks and reinforces chocolate flavour.",
				"4. Using an electric egg whisk, whip the chickpea water into stiff peaks \u2013 this is SUPER important as otherwise your mousse will deflate completely once the chocolate has been added. The best way to check if you have achieved stiff peaks is to invert the bowl with whipped aquafaba. If aquafaba slides down even a tiny bit, you are not there yet \u2013 keep on whipping until it does not move at all. I used an old, hand-held whisk and it took me about 10 minutes to get stiff peaks.\u00a0If you are a lucky owner of a stand mixer, it will happen quicker. The good news is that (as opposed to egg whites) aquafaba cannot be overwhipped.",
				"5. OPTIONAL Once you reach stiff peaks, start adding sugar, bit by bit, whipping the whole time. If sugar has caused the stiff peaks to perish, whip the mixture until you get stiff peaks again. Caster (also known as superfine) sugar or icing sugar are preferred. Other sugars are known to make aquafaba deflate too much.",
				"6. Check that the chocolate has cooled down sufficiently \u2013 it should not be warm to the touch or else chocolate is likely to seize and you will end up with grainy mousse.",
				"7. Gently and gradually fold a portion (approx. a quarter) of melted chocolate into whipped aquafaba (or whipped aquafaba into the melted chocolate \u2013 I\u2019ve heard claims that it stops chocolate from seizing, but I haven\u2019t noticed any difference personally) \u2013 using a silicone spatula and a gentle folding motion. Continue adding the chocolate to the aquafaba in small increments until all of it has been incorporated. Do not worry if your fluffy mixture deflates a bit once all of the chocolate has been added \u2013 that\u2019s perfectly normal \u2013 but you should still see plenty micro bubbles in the mixture. By the time you\u2019ve added all of your melted chocolate, the mousse MAY have more of a pourable than spoonable consistency \u2013 that\u2019s ok.",
				"8. Add chilli powder if using and mix well. Divide the mixture between 4 glasses. Gently stir the mixture between putting it into individual glasses as a bit of melted chocolate tends to drop to the bottom sometimes. Once in glass, give the mousses a gentle stir with a toothpick to ensure the mixture sets evenly.",
				"9. Put glasses into the fridge overnight for the mousse to set."

				"Absolutely amazing and easy recipe and makes a fun guessing game for unassuming guests, they NEVER guess the secret ingredient. Keep up the amazing inspiration!",
				"Recipe seems great and really easy. Succeeded on my first attempt, but second and first were a fail. Even after whipping for 30 min couldn\u2019t get the Aquafaba not to slide, despite having used completely grease free utensils? So I gave up on it. After folding the chocolate in, The mix deflated and I got a soupy consistency:(",
				"Great recipe, thank you for sharing! I used my to go to water ganache recipe for the melted chocolate and had no issues with seizing! Taste great after 4 hours in the fridge looking forward to trying it tomorrow. :)",
				"Thanks a lot Lazy cat! I've made those for my friend's wedding and everybody loved it :) And I've enjoyed making them and am similarly excited about aquafaba! I love to use it in baked things too - banana bread or sticky ginger bread :)",
				"Truly amazing! You need to make this recipe. It\u2019s surprising and so delicious.",
				"I made the 2-ingredient mousse recipe in the video featured on this page. It was astounding to see bean juice become what looked like stiff egg whites \ud83e\udd2f I never imagined that I\u2019d be getting protein from beans in my chocolate mousse, but this stuff is good! Like I\u2019d serve this to other people.. good! If you want to do a quick fun cooking experiment some evening, get yourself some chocolate and a can of garbanzo beans. You\u2019ll amaze your friends and family. For sure! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc9a",
				"Amazingly simple and looks and tastes so delicious. The first time I made this I skipped the sugar but when making it for others who wanted a sweeter mousse and my  chocolate had very little sugar, I added a tbsp more sugar. It tasted great topped with chopped mango.",
				"Tried this recipe for the first time as was curious to see how it would turn out, and never having used chick pea juice as a substitute for egg whites. What a revelation!  I had the aquafaba cool, not chilled and not exactly at room temperature. I used ordinary dark chocolate however I boiled the water in the kettle first, put it in the pan then placed the bowl of chocolate over it so melted it slowly. I found by doing it this way I didn't overheat the chocolate.  I then let stand for about five minutes before adding it to the whisked aquafaba. I used a silicone spatula and folded it in slowly.  The result....... a delicious mousse that my husband has declared the best! Win win all round.",
				"I made this with 90% cocoa chocolate and despite my best efforts it seized. But this has happened before with other similar recipes and I have found that carefully stirring in a few glugs of avocado oil loosens it enough to enable it to blend perfectly with the aqua faba. End result is a fabulously smooth, darkly chocolaty, velvety mouse.",
				"My family goes crazy for this mousse! Thank you so muchCiao from your fan from Torino!Susanna",
				"Hi, can I freeze this mousse? I accidentally made too much of it\ud83d\ude05.Many thanks ;-)",
				"I made this recipe for a New Years dessert with close friends and followed the recipe to a tee. It looked fine when it was placed into the fridge, but upon taking it out a little while later, the chocolate had seized and the texture was terrible (fluffy Aquafaba, firm dark chocolate bits). It tasted good, but there is no way I would serve this to friends. Very disappointing.",
				"This is the second year i have made this for a Christmas treat and it is delicious! I use 70% dark choc from my local bulk foods, i found that it worked better than the block stuff from the supermarket. Super easy and quick to make",
				"This looks delicious and I would like to try it. Is it possible to substitute cocoa powder for the chocolate?",
				"Mine went all grainy when I added the chocolate, I used room temp aquafaba and the chocolate was definitely cool. I did use half 85% eating chocolate and then half 40% cooking chocolate, could that have been the problem?",
				"Fabulous. I\u2019ve recently become terribly lactose intolerant, and I couldn\u2019t  even tell that this was dairy free. Used 72% percent chocolate chips, and  held the chili. Came together quickly and deliciously! Served it with coconut whipped cream. Will make again and check out more of your recipes! Thanks!",
				"I made this and it turned out grainy. I let the chocolate cool down, but maybe not enough? I see some other comments of people adding plant based milk to their chocolate but I don\u2019t see that in the recipe. Should I try adding milk with my chocolate or just let it cool even more before adding it to the whip next time? Thanks :) I really want this recipe to work for me",
				"Absolutely fantastic! Followed all instructions and ended up with gorgeous vegan dessert! Chilli flakes gave it special zing!"

				"Bonjour Ania,I make your recipe for Yemista regularly since a few years now and again last week and we adore them!  They are especially good the next day and eaten cold or at room temperature in my opinion \ud83d\ude09. I don't sugar the insides of the peppers and we prefer red and yellow ones taste wise. Sometimes I put capers in place of the raisins...Thank you so much for your great vegan recipes!!!",

Can I put them in the fridge and then reheat them for the dinner the next day?  What did you do that worked best?Thank you, I cannot wait to try this!xx",
				"Looks great - does this recipe freeze okay?",
				"Ania, can we do this with already prepared rice? I have a bunch in my fridge. How would I adjust the recipe?",
				"Brown or white rice? Thanks! I love your recipes.",
				"The green peppers I prepare them with meat can be chicken, turkey or three and potato and are very good, but I will make the recipe that you publish in this article have as I have.",
				"This recipe is absolutely delicious! It's so rich with flavor and so easy to make \u2013 I've made it 3 times already in the past month!"

I'm wondering if I could brush them with a bit of olive oil on a parchment lined baking sheet, then try to do them in the oven instead of frying. Has any one tried doing that? Then instead of a bun serve it as the protein, with a little vegan mushroom gravy, and the rest of the vegan friendly side dishes.  The seasonings sound wonderful, especially the smoked paprika."

				"1. Wash asparagus and snap the wooden ends off (or cut them off with a knife). Coat asparagus in 1 tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
				"2. Put a small pot of water to boil. Cook broad beans in the boiling water for about 5 minutes \u2013 until they are soft in the centre. While the beans are cooking, prepare a bowl of cold water and a few ice cubes. As soon as the beans are cooked, drain them and plunge them into the icy water \u2013 this will stop the discolouration process. Shell them and set aside.",
				"3. Chop almonds and mint leaves very finely. Mix them both in with lemon zest, nutritional yeast (if using), salt, pepper and lemon juice. Set aside.",
				"4. Heat up 2 tbsp of oil in a heavy bottom pan. Fry the onion until translucent, stirring frequently. Add in the garlic and leek and fry for another minute or two.",
				"5. Add risotto rice and coat it in the aromatics, stirring often to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn. Keep on frying the rice until it turns slightly translucent \u2013 this should take around 1-2 minutes.",
				"6. Pour all the wine in at once. Cook the rice in the wine for a few minutes until the rice has absorbed all of it. Don\u2019t forget to stir frequently.",
				"7. Add a generous pinch of salt. Start adding hot stock, little by little. Make sure you only add the bare minimum of stock at one time \u2013 i.e. the rice isn\u2019t supposed to swim in the stock, the stock should simply make sure the rice doesn\u2019t dry out. Stir the risotto regularly, but refrain from stirring all the time as it will lower the temperature and aerate the rice.",
				"8. While topping up the risotto, heat up a griddle pan (or a regular pan). Griddle previously prepped asparagus on a hot griddle pan until nicely charred, turning a few times. Chop into 2-3 cm pieces and set aside.",
				"9. Continue adding the stock until you\u2019ve used it all up. This usually takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Cooked rice should still retain a bit of a bite. Season your risotto and add in the cooked vegetables. Put the lid on the pan and let it stand for 1\u00a0minute. Serve with the gremolata sprinkled on top."

				"A hummus is not a hummus if it is not made with chickpeas (Arabic name for them is hummus) and when we make hummus paste and essential ingredient is sesame paste or what we call Tahina . On another thought my favorite broad bean dish is when you get them very small and you cook them without shelling them in a bit of water. When they are soft you add olive oil garlic which has  been crushed, and minced coriander.. salt to your taste... We eat it with pita bread",
				"I liked it...it reminded me a little of guacamole. I did't have fresh mint so used  dried...couple of pinches."

				"Hlo! Thanks for the great recipe, we made some yesterday and they were delicious :D one find we had: if you bake them in a hot pan with some olive oil, they become even fluffier and softer for extra tastiness and curry absorption abilities. Naans are originally baked in a Tandoor grill - so the fast heat increase is essential to getting lots of oven spring. Cheers!",

						"4. Form small discs with your hands and place them on a lightly floured surface.",
						"5. Pour about 1 cm of oil into a pan. Slowly (on a medium heat) heat up oil \u2013 it take a good few minutes. You don\u2019t want the oil too hot as the falafels will brown too quickly and remain raw in the middle. After a few minutes, you can test the oil by putting a bit of mixture in it. If the oil around it sizzles and the mixture is getting brown slowly (i.e. doesn\u2019t not burn straight away), do another test by placing one falafel in the middle of the pan. If it takes about 3-4 minutes to get it golden brown on one side then the oil is the right temperature. If it has barely changed the colour, the oil needs heating up more. If it gets brown too quickly, you need to let your oil cool down slightly.",
						"6. Once you are happy with oil temperature, place several falafels in the oil and set the timer to 3 minutes before flipping them and frying for another 3 minutes on the other side. Beware that usually the falafel that\u2019s in a middle of the pan will be done a bit sooner and the ones at the edges may need an extra minute or so. Keep an eye on them the whole time and rotate in the pan if necessary.",

I do have a question about a bread roll recipe I love... when I use homemade meal vs store bought, the rolls are more dense, dry and smaller. Could this be because store bought uses the whole almond and therefore has more moisture than homemade using just the pulp? Should I try reducing the amount of homemade meal in the recipe to see if it works better? Any advice would be great.Thanks, Suzi.",

				"1. Set the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 350\u00b0 F. Spread the nuts on a baking tray and roast for about 6\u00a0minutes until they are just golden (you don\u2019t want them to turn brown as they will taste bitter). If using unpeeled nuts, roast them for a bit longer. Once ready, put them into a clean kitchen towel and rub them against each other so that skins become loose and come off more easily. Don\u2019t worry if there are a few stubborn ones with skin left on.",
				"2. While the roasted nuts are cooling off, prepare the sugar syrup by dissolving brown sugar in 3 tbsp of water on a very low heat. In a separate bowl melt the chocolate over a water bath. Prepare your espresso.",
				"3. Once hazelnuts have cooled down, put them into a food processor and process until the nuts release their natural oil and the mixture reaches a smooth consistency. Don\u2019t be discouraged if it looks like it won\u2019t happen; it will. This really depends on how powerful your food processor is and it may take some time. The mixture goes through various stages (see the picture in this post), make sure to stop the processor now and then and scrape the mixture off the walls. If your food processor gets too warm, give it a rest for a few minutes and resume once it has cooled down.",
				"4. Once the nut butter has reached the correct consistency, add in melted chocolate, salt, vanilla seeds, espresso and sugar syrup. Process until smoothish \u2013 (you won\u2019t be able to achieve super smooth consistency unless you have a kick-arse food machine like a Vitamix) but I personally do not mind that you can see bits of ground nuts. It makes it more rustic and real.",
				"5. Once you add chocolate to the mix, it may seem like the mixture has gone funny, it all bunches up again into a glistening mass. Don\u2019t worry, at this point add a bit of water, a little at a time and keep on processing until the mixture loosens up a bit. Some recipes out there use coconut oil to make the mixture more creamy, for example, but I find it unnecessary given that nuts have so much oil in them already.",

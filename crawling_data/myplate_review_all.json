When the Tofu is done just cut in chunks and add to vegetables that you have stir fried."

May I suggest using a clove of minced garlic as well as chopped onion for extra flavor and vitamins.

It will add a touch of protein and color and make it suitable for breakfast too!"

Also, the (non-Asian) peanuts are a problem for many people.  To make the salad safer, more interesting and tasty (and a bit Asian), we substituted cashew nuts for peanuts and added a bit of ground ginger to the salad dressing.  With those variations, the salad was popular.  It is certainly simple to make and offers a nice balance of fruit, veggies and protein.  P.S.  I hope someone will correct the typos in the recipe."

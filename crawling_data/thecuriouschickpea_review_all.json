I dried some leftover injera in the oven (I was going to order Tsiona&#8217;s injera crisps &#8211; they sound amazing, but they cost $90 to ship to Canada!!)",
				"Thank you so much for introducing me to the injera crisps by Tsiona Foods! They immediately became a favorite snack in my house! I no longer live in a place where I can buy fresh injera at the grocery store and these somewhat fill that craving too!"

Roast the jalape\u00f1oso on a baking tray under the broiler until the skins are blackened (~7-10 minutes). Turn every 2-3 minutes to roast evenly. Put roasted peppers in a bowl and cover to allow the steam to loosen the skin. Set aside while you prepare the chickpeas. ",

Pour the mixture over the chickpeas and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes, stirring, until it has thickened and coats the chickpeas. Taste and add salt if desired. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to assemble the salad.",

Process until relatively smooth. Taste and adjust any seasoning to taste. If necessary, add more water to thin or tahini to thicken.",

Stack the de-stemmed kale leaves and roll them tightly, then slice into ~1/4 inch thick slices before chopping once or twice in the opposite direction to make bite sized pieces.",

				"3. Add the black beans, vegan chorizo (chopped up if it isn't already in a ground texture), chili powder, oregano, cumin, and cayenne. Use less cayenne to keep it mild or use more to make it spicy.",
				"4. Saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes or until the mixture is heated through and the chorizo is lightly browned. Add salt to taste, how much depends on the saltiness of the vegan chorizo, I used about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove from  heat and let the mixture cool to about room temperature.",
				"5. Roll out a sheet of defrosted puff pastry to about a 10 by 12 inch rectangle. It doesn't need to be exact. Layer on about half the vegan cheese and half the bean and chorizo mixture. Top with half the sliced scallions.",
				"6. Starting from the short end, gently roll the pastry up to make a log. Press the log with your hands to seal the seam and stick layers a bit. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry and the remaining filling.",
				"7. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap or place in a sealed container and put it in the fridge for 20 minutes for the puff pastry to chill. You can leave it at this point for up to 1-2 days, if you want to prepare it in advance.",
				"8. After chilling, uncover the roll and trim the edges to make a flat cut on either side. Slice each log into about 12 slices, it's ok if you end up with fewer however.",
				"9. Lay the slices on the baking trays, leaving a couple inches of space between them as they will expand in the oven. Bake for 18-20 minutes at 400 \u00baF or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted.",
				"10. Enjoy warm or at room temperature with your favorite taco toppers (e.g. guacamole, vegan sour cream, salsa, hot sauce)."

				"This is the crispiest tofu recipe I have found so far since becoming vegan over 3 years ago.    My husband works late so instead of tossing the tofu completely in Buffalo sauce and having it get soggy, I just drizzled some over the top of the Buddha bowl I made for dinner.  He can add more later if he wants.   Really great recipe!",
				"Draining tofu should be in the prep time. As should enough time to bread the tofu. Dinner will be an hour late,not that it\u2019s your problem, but this was not easy or quick.",
				"Made these last night for dinner and they are amazing!!!! Took the left overs for lunch today and almost as good. Thank you so much.",
				"I made these tofu wings last night, following the recipe as written, and my boyfriend loved them! I do not like buffalo sauce so I tossed mine in BBQ sauce and put them on a bun &#8211; it was an awesome sandwich. Thanks for sharing!",
				"I have been looking forward to making these for weeks. Today, I finally got around to it, and they were absolutely DELICIOUS!!",
				"would this still work using a medium firm tofu if i just press it beforehand for a lot longer?",
				"This is one of my favorite salads! I keep it in our regular rotation and love including it when I have anyone over who \u201cisn\u2019t in to tofu\u201d. They are always pleasantly surprised. Thank you!",
				"Wow these were incredible! Since starting my journey in Januray (now March), I&#8217;ve been craving wings so bad and now I have them muhahahaha! I would say after the initial 25 minute bake &#8211; follow-up with a 5 minute bake instead of the full 10 to avoid it being overly crispy. Otherwise 10/10 recipe!!!!!",
				"I must have done something slightly wrong. The taste was great and the breaded tofu was super crispy&#8230;until I threw them in the mixing bowl and tossed them in the sauce. They became very soggy. Still tasted great and will be good on salad, but not exactly what I was ho[ing for.",
				"These were SO good!!",
				"These are SO GOOD!! I&#8217;m a new vegetarian and was really missing buffalo wings- these are a great replacement!",
				"I&#8217;ve made these a few times now and it&#8217;s one of my favorite recipes! I&#8217;m not vegan, but I love that the tofu makes them feel a bit healthier while still keeping the Buffalo taste.",
				"Delicious! Even my daughter, who doesn\u2019t like tofu, liked it. I highly recommend trying it!",
				"Just made these&#8230; They are SOOOOOOO good!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.",
				"These are the BEST vegetarian wings I have ever had! Franks is my favorite hot sauce and I like to dip with creamy parm dip i buy at a local chain restaurant.  I don&#8217;t miss chicken at all.  Thanks for this recipe!  I look forward to trying it with mac &amp; cheese.",

				"This recipe is just the best. You can change up the seasonings and hot sauces and it&#8217;s still fantastic.  Can&#8217;t stop sharing it with my friends.",
				"I have never posted a review on a recipe before but this was great!! Will for sure make again. Thank you!",
				"These were a huge hit! We will definitely be using this recipe again. Lots of flavor + good texture. Other buffalo tofu recipes we\u2019ve tried have been really dull inside but this was not lacking at all.  Thanks for sharing!",
				"I didn&#8217;t have any breadcrumbs so I used oats and put them in a food processor. Weren&#8217;t crispy but I still loved it!!!!",
				"Made these tonight and they were lovely! Used regular bread crumbs, maybe not *as* crispy but still delicious! Made them in my toaster over and broiled them to crisp them up more. Dipped them in a quick home made tzatziki. I&#8217;ll definitely be making them again!\nThanks Eva, can&#8217;t wait to check out more of your recipes (:",
				"I have made these over four times. They are amazing. I\u2019m newly vegan. This recipe has  saved me. Thanks",
				"Great recipe!  Followed almost exactly but just forgot the oil!  No matter they were still crispy good.  Thank you!",
				"Just tried these vegan tofu bites. They are absolutely delicious. Ever since giving up meat buffalo chicken was one of the things that I really missed\u2026 These definitely do it for me. I made these for my husband\u2019s birthday along with some vegan mac &amp; cheese for a southern style birthday dinner. Definitely super excited for these. They will definitely be becoming part of our regular meal lineup yet. Thank you so much for this recipe",
				"I was so impressed with this recipe! It tasted so good and the texture was great. The only issue I had was I felt like they tasted too buttery, next time is probably use little to no vegan butter and just stick with dipping them in the hot sauce. I will definitely be making these again though and was still so pleased with how they turned out \ud83d\ude42",
				"I actually have the same question.  I would like to try these with tempeh, I feel like this would give it more texture.  Any feedback from someone who has tried the recipe with tempeh would be appreciated.",
				"Made exactly as directed &#8211; it was absolutely delicious!  We are definitely making this again.",
				"Definitely a late reply, but we&#8217;ve used convection bake on our air fryer to dramatically cut the cooking time on these &#8211; something like 8 minutes with no flip required.",
				"Do you think this same recipe could be used for cauliflower?or  tempeh? One of our favorite places does tempeh wings and they&#8217;re so nice and crispy (obviously fried!) but we&#8217;d love to try a healthier version.",
				"This was amazing! I made a batch and then made more later in the week it was just so good. We ate it as a salad with blue cheese- which I have never liked before. It was very good with this. I just used the franks buffalo sauce as the sauce for the tofu and it was delicious and easy. I think the base recipe of the tofu sticks would be great with other sauces too- a lemon-y sauce to make a vegan lemon chicken.",
				"I don\u2019t know what I did wrong!! I was so excited to eat these and they ended up just tasting like cornstarch. I used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko, but don\u2019t think that should make too much of a difference. ???",
				"These exceeded my expectations. Buffalo wings are my number 1 craving, and these were fantastic. I served them in wraps with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and avocado. A creamy dressing would pair beautifully. As a vegan buffalo wing recipe 10/10 would recommend. Can&#8217;t wait to try the recipe with other sauces, too. Thank you!",
				"I am so impressed with this recipe! I made it using Frank&#8217;s new Buffalo Wings sauce. I forgot the 2 Tbsp. olive oil in the panko mixture but the tofu still turned out crispy and delicious. I did have to flip the wings about 15 minutes in to avoid browning them too much, but that could be a result of the lack of oil. They turned out very spicy and fantastic with light ranch dressing.\nThank you so much!",
				"These were soooo gooood &#8211; thank you!",
				"Just made this recipe and absolutely *loved* it. My husband isn&#8217;t keen on tofu, but I think I&#8217;ve got him hooked on this recipe. We absolutely adored the base tofu recipe without the sauce. The sauce nearly killed my hubby&#8217;s sensitive taste buds, so I had to tame it a bit. I will definitely be making this again though.",
				"I&#8217;ve been eyeing this recipe for a while now and am dying to make a salad w/ it, as pictured! Just curious what other veggies would go well w/ it? And if kale can be used instead of romaine?\nThanks so much!",
				"I made these tofu wings last night for dinner with some sweet potato chips a salad, and OMG they were so delicious. I used encona hot pepper sauce instead because thats what we had in the cupboard. I will definitely be making the again, everyone loved them!",

				"We like this recipe so much that we are making the tofu into small cubes to have on skewers with sweet yellow peppers and cherry peppers for my daughter&#8217;s wedding reception.  We&#8217;ll have Follow Your Heart Bleu Cheese and JUST Ranch for the sauce options.",
				"We are a newly vegetarian couple and my boyfriends son is still a meat-eater. He had no idea this wasn\u2019t chicken or that the dressing (we used Daiya) was vegan!  We used regular butter instead of vegan butter bc it\u2019s what we had. But we LOVED this recipe!",

				"I was a bit disappointed with all the positive reviews.  It was decent but I feel the actual tofu needed some kind of  marinade for it to make me want to make it again.",

				"This turned out amazing! I didn\u2019t have \u201cfollow your heart\u201d ranch or blue cheese, but I do have vegannaise, mrs dash onion &amp; herb, and unsweetened soy milk on hand. That makes a great ranch dressing in a pinch. \ud83d\ude09",

				"Just made these! So so good!!!",
				"What should I do to reheat it?",

				"Girrrrrllll! This recipe is incredible!  I\u2019m not a picky eater but rarely does a dish make me want to dance on the table. I didn\u2019t, but I wanted to. We had the wings on greens, topped sweet peppers, celery and cherry tomatoes. I thought I would never again get to eat buffalo style food but this has brought new hope. Now I have something to eat on \u201cgame day\u201d besides guacamole and chips. My roomies (who aren\u2019t vegan) loved it too and want me to make it again soon. Thank you so much! .",

				"Thank you for this recipe! It tastes so similar to Upton\u2019s bacon mac ! I would suggest using 2 packages of Upton\u2019s bacon though. And I would suggest mixing the mac noodles and sauce in a separate pan, reserve some of the sauce. Cook the bacon til pretty crisp, then remove from the pan. In a nice cast iron pan, heat up a bit of oil, then add a few servings of mac and cheese, a thin layer. Let it toast, turn once, and then add plenty of the bacon right at the end so it\u2019s still crispy. At Upton\u2019s, their mac is more dry, so I that\u2019s why I\u2019ll reserve some of the sauce next time. A bit more dry to get that crisp on it. Maybe some toasted breadcrumbs to finish it? It was absolutely delish. So happy that you were able to capture the strong cheesy flavor in that sauce! Can\u2019t wait to re-crisp the leftovers tomorrow, maybe I\u2019ll grab some more bacon and add that too! Thanks again, very enjoyable, and saved me a trip to the city!"

				"These meat(less)balls are just fantastic! I&#8217;ve made them more than a few times now and they never disappoint. I wouldn&#8217;t say that the texture is similar to a regular meatball since they are a bit more crumbly and mushy, but the flavor is INCREDIBLE. My partner and I don&#8217;t miss meatballs at all when we eat these. So glad to have found this recipe- it&#8217;s become a favorite in our home!",
				"Do you have any suggestions on what could be used instead of pecans, for a nut free version?",
				"Oh how embarrassing &#8211; it does say that in the recipe, I just missed it! Thanks for clarifying though. Looking forward to trying this. I love your masoor dal tadka recipe and I&#8217;m trying to expand my vegan/vegetarian repertoire.",
				"I&#8217;m excited to try this. Can you clarify on the chickpeas &#8211; should they be cooked dried chickpeas, or canned? I am guessing the former since you refer to using the reserved cooking liquid. I do have a couple cans on hand that I need to use up, so I am curious if you have tried this out with canned, and if so, do you have any recommendations or modifications? \nThanks!"

				"I have made a fair bit of Chana Masala in the past 10 years but this one is our favorite. It is SO excellent. So easy to make. Hard to believe but its even better the second day.",
				"This was my first homemade Indian dish. After I found all the ingredients &#8211; I live near a big Indian neighborhood &#8211; I was surprised at how simple the recipe was to prepare. I don&#8217;t have anything to compare it with, since I&#8217;ve never tried it anywhere, but this was delicious! Looking at other recipes, and from what I&#8217;ve probably seen on Indian restaurant buffets, Chana Masala looks soupy. I&#8217;m glad this one wasn&#8217;t, but I had to stir it frequently to keep it from sticking. I used dried garbanzos, soaked overnight and cooked, added a couple extra red chili peppers, and served it with brown basmati rice. I will be making this often, since I now have a lifetime supply of Indian spices. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
				"My family\u2019s Christmas Eve tradition is to gather with our Jewish friends for Indian food. So this year, I made Eva\u2019s chana masala, biryani, raita, and mango lassi for a feast at home. These are, by far, absolutely the most delicious Indian recipes I\u2019ve ever made &#8211; and I\u2019ve made recipes from many sources. I&#8217;ve finally found my go-to chana masala recipe now &#8211; no need for all the others I&#8217;ve tried over the years! Thank you, Eva &#8211; I will come back to your recipes again and again!",
				"definitely it is looking restaurant like chana masala. and I am sure it would taste like one. I always prefer to use tomato instead of amchur I hope this is ok. is it? thank you for sharing this blog.",
				"Great recipe. I used about 2 pounds of fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and 1 tbsp tamarind concentrate instead of mango powder. The sauce was slightly on the acidic side, so I added 1/2 tsp sugar to balance it out.",
				"Great recipe, must warn though that amchur is strong stuff indeed. I put in a heaped teaspoon and at first I thought \u201cmy goodness, tastes of cleaning powder\u201d. Next time maybe half a teaspoon for me. Perhaps more garum masala, a teaspoon or even two. A little more methi maybe.\nIt\u2019s all taste though of course and this is an awesome recipe, thanks again \ud83d\ude42",
				"Wow&#8230; amazing description and details&#8230;",
				"If I want to make a smaller batch (for 2 people) should I reduce the amount of spices accordingly? I.e if making half the batch, should I use half the amount of spices? Thank you! So excited to make this!!",
				"I made this recipe, trying to stick to the recipe as close as I could, and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for sharing this one!",
				"Lacking pomi, I ran a can of diced tomatoes through a blender with 2 tbsp plain tomato paste with good results.  Next time I&#8217;ll leave out the cayenne and add a minced jalapeno.  Dutch oven on the stove top at moderate temperature, it came out great.  Thank you.",
				"Wow!  This was amazing.  I used 3 peppers and it was the perfect heat.  I served this dish with curried fried rice&#8230;. just delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",
				"This is a delicious and flavorful recipe. But don\u2019t add the full amount of spices unless you want a burning hot dish. I had to add more chickpeas, two more cans of diced tomatoes, and coconut milk to dilute it enough to eat. But it is a great recipe and very simple to prepare. Just adjust the seasons to the level of spiciness you prefer.",
				"A bit too much tomato for my taste, otherwise very nice",
				"I bought a garam masala spice mix. Im wondering how much i should use as it has all the spices blended together. Thanks",
				"Do you skin your chickpeas before adding them to the masala? Also would crushed red pepper flakes work as a sub for the dried red hot chilies? Thank you!",
				"I prefer to cook my chickpeas rather than use a can. Have you ever done that? Looking at the recipe it looks like I would only need to leave out the salt until the end. Thoughts?",
				"This dish is soooo great! We serve it with long grain brown rice and its just the perfect mix and so hearty. I have tried your lentil bolognese too and its so good! Love, love, love your recipes. I can&#8217;t wait to try more!! Thanks for making it easy and delicious to eat vegan : )",
				"WHAT can I sub for the carton of strained tomatoes? An equally size can of diced tomatoes or crushed ones?",
				"If I don&#8217;t have cardamom pods, can I substitute ground cardamom, and if so, how much?",
				"Husband has a mango allergy. How about substituting Anardana powder instead?",
				"Followed exactly. This is the best C.M. recipe I\u2019ve ever made. It will be my new go-to. Thanks!!",

			"title": "Easy Homemade Vegan Gnocchi Recipe",
			"ingredients": [
				"1 lb 4 oz (535g) baked and peeled russet potatoes* (~4 1/2 cups riced, unpacked)",
				"1 tsp (5g) salt",
				"2 tbsp (20g) olive oil",
				"2 1/2 cups (284g) all purpose flour, more as needed"
			],
			"time": "40 minutes",
			"serving": "2 lbs cooked gnocchi",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Take the peeled, cooked and cooled potatoes and cut them into sections. Using one section at a time, press them through a potato ricer. Alternatively, mash them well so that no lumps remain.",
				"2. In a large bowl add the riced or mashed potato, salt, olive oil, and flour and using clean hands mix the ingredients together and then squeeze to gently knead it into a cohesive ball. If the mixture is sticky add flour until it no longer sticks to your hand. If you can't get the flour to fully absorb and mix into the potatoes add a little extra olive oil until it comes together. The key is to not have a wet and sticky dough so that it's easy to work with and form into little dumplings.",
				"3. Keeping the dough covered so it doesn't dry out, take a small section at a time to form into the gnocchi. Take a 1 tsp (~6g) piece of dough and squeeze it in your fist to make a compact and roughly shaped ball, then roll it between your palms to make it round.",
				"4. For the traditional gnocchi shape with the grooves on one side, place a fork sitting face down on the counter and take the ball and place it at the top of the backside of the tines of the fork. With your thumb on the piece of dough, slide the gnocchi down the tines of the fork until you reach the counter. The gnocchi will turn under your thumb until it has grooves going around about 3/4 of the dough and a small inset divot where your thumb was.",
				"5. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. If the dough becomes sticky at any point, toss shaped gnocchi with flour so they don't stick together and knead a bit of extra flour into the remaining unshaped dough.",
				"6. To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add half the gnocchi to the pot and let it cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the top and have cooked an additional minute at the top. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and then cook the second batch of gnocchi.",
				"7. Use the cooked gnocchi in your favorite recipe, or store in the fridge for up to a week (you can freeze for longer)."

				"Always thought gnocchi above my skill level.  After reading this recipe and watching the video decided to give a try.  The step by step detailed instructions made it a breeze.  Came out perfect the very 1st attempt!   Baked Gnocchi with Arrabbiata and Vegan Mozzarella on the menu tonight.",
				"Hi! Do you think I can use instant mashed potatoes and it will work?",
				"I made I small batch of these delicious \ud83d\ude0b gnocchi for the #danielfast and they were great so I stayed up until about 3:00am making more for my family for dinner Tomorrow. Since there are six of us I was rolling and cutting dough for quite a while but it is worth it! I love this and I wish I could add pictures because they came out great!",
				"Okay. I love this recipe. I&#8217;m so happy to have found a vegan recipe for gnocchi! I followed the instructions (though didn&#8217;t weigh my potatoes :/ ) and got a pretty good result. However, the dough had a hard time staying together, even when I added a ton more olive oil. After perusing the comments a bit I see others had the same problem when using gluten-free flour, which I did. The remedy seems to be adding a couple flax &#8220;eggs&#8221; to bind the dough. I will definitely try that next time I make this, cuz I definitely want to try again!\nOh also, even though I struggled to get the gnocchi to stay in shape, they held together just fine when cooking. The end result was super sticky because of all the oil I used, so I laid them out to dry a bit on a sheet of parchment paper so that they didn&#8217;t all glob together.",
				"This was pretty good.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the flavor of olive oil with some foods.  This is one of them.  The next time I do this recipe (cuz I will) I&#8217;ll use grapeseed oil or something like that. I&#8217;m also thinking of plant based butter with this.  I paired this with a vegan mushroom sauce. I&#8217;ll def try it again!!",
				"Could I use oat flour instead?\nThank you",
				"I&#8217;ve had trouble making vegan gnocchi in the past, it has been very hard to roll out and hasn&#8217;t bound properly. I love this recipe! I peeled then boiled my potatoes because I find it easier that way, and I had excellent results \ud83d\ude42",
				"Thank you for posting this recipe. It was super easy and informative. I made it yesterday and my gnocchi came out great. ?\u2764",
				"Please, what is contained in All Purpose Flour. My husband is allergic to wheat, and I have just bought my first bag of Gram Flour.\nTIA. Jjanette",
				"I did 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular potato. I forgot that I was low on AP flour so I had to use mostly whole wheat flour. I put in way more than 2.5 cups flour and it was STILL sticky. I ran out of whole wheat flour too, and it was still way too sticky to shape, so I had to throw it out unfortunately.",
				"it says above the recipe\n You can reheat cooked gnocchi either in the sauce it\u2019s being served in, or by blanching briefly in boiling water. You can also toast it on the stove in a bit of olive oil\nHope this helps",
				"I made these gnocchi and they were absolutely delicious. I am so pleased with this recipe and the result. I tried to make gnocchi once before and it was a disaster, so am really chuffed with the result tonight. I also crisped them in olive oil and added them to saut\u00e9ed garlic, spinach, red sweet pepper and chilli with some vegan rashers thrown in. Vegan Parmesan sprinkled on top. Oh so yummy ?",
				"I tried this and really worked!\nMy little one has gluten  allergy and I could never make fresh pasta.\nThis was so delicious and she loved it.\nThank you",
				"Just use gluten free flour",
				"Tried this recipe. Way too much flour in my opinion. I would recommend starting with 1cup.",
				"It is a great recipe! So easy ( a bit long, but hey, I&#8217;m not complaining) simple and fun to make! I really enjoyed making gnocchi for the first time. I roasted the potatoes on my microwave and they had the perfect texture ( although I killed the microwave in the process of cooking the last potato&#8230;) But seriously, it is really good thank you for the recipe. \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi. Do you think this would work with Yukon gold potatoes? Thanks.",
				"This recipe was perfect. I don&#8217;t have anything else to say, thanks for the help \ud83d\ude42",
				"I made them yesterday and they were delicious! But I definitely disagree here. The ammount I got was for serving 4 people very well, or 5 or 6 people with a decent size plate without repeating. I served it with tomato sauce and veggies",
				"Planning to make gnocchi tomorrow. Can\u2019t wait.. recipe looks easy enough and you have walked Us through the possible pitfalls.",
				"Hi there! I\u2019m hoping to make this for dinner tonight, how many people does this recipe serve? Thanks!",
				"Can I freeze the gnocchi?",
				"Thank you so much Daniel. I JUST got your reply today, 2/3/2020 and that is the only reason you did not hear from me sooner. God Bless you for the info &lt;3",
				"Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I served this in a pesto soup and people loved it!",
				"I just made them with Pamela&#8217;s all-porpoise GF flour. The dough broke apart so I added a couple &#8220;vegan eggs&#8221; for a binder and that helped hold the dough together. To make a vegan egg just combine  2 tbsp flax seed and 6 tbsp warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. Dump that into the dough and it will help bind.",

				"Need a gluten-free vegan version please&#8230;..love gnocchi and hated giving them up",

			"title": "Homemade Vegan Wontons",
			"ingredients": [
				"1 cup TVP",
				"1 cup boiling water",
				"1 tbsp oil",
				"2 tbsp chopped scallions, white and light green parts",
				"3-4 cloves garlic, minced",
				"2 tsp minced ginger",
				"1/2 tsp crushed red pepper",
				"2 tbsp soy sauce",
				"salt, to taste if needed",
				"2 tsp toasted sesame oil",
				"1 package vegan wonton wrappers (should contain ~48 wrappers)"
			],
			"time": "50 minutes",
			"serving": "4 dozen",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Combine TVP and boiling water in a heat proof bowl. Set aside to hydrate, about 10 minutes.",
				"2. Heat a skillet over medium heat, add the oil, scallion, garlic, ginger, and red pepper. Saut\u00e9 for about 30-60 seconds.",
				"3. Add the hydrated TVP and saut\u00e9 about 3 minutes until its lightly browned. Mix in the soy sauce, then taste and add salt if desired. Turn off the heat and add the toasted sesame oil. Set aside and let the filling cool enough to handle.",
				"4. Shape the wontons: Place a wrapper in your palm and fill it with about 1 teaspoon of the filling. Rub water along the edge of the wrapper then fold the dumpling in half to make a rectangle. Add water to the bottom two corners, then bend them together to touch. Press to seal while pushing out air from the dumpling.Alternative shape: Wet the edges of the wrapper and bring two opposite corners to touch, then bring the remaining two corners to meet in the center. Pinch the edges together to seal, pushing air out while doing so.",
				"5. Dumplings can be cooked immediately or frozen to cook at a later time. To freeze, spread out on a baking tray in a single layer. Let freeze solid, then transfer to a sealable freezer bag. Cook from frozen, dumplings will take slightly longer to cook.",
				"6. Deep Fry Instructions: Heat oil to 350 \u00baF and add dumplings a few at a time so as not to crowd the oil. Fry for 1-2 minutes or until golden. Flip or press them down in the oil using a spider strainer to cook evenly. Remove and let drain on a paper towel. Repeat until dumplings are cooked.Steam & Pan Fry Instructions: Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add oil then place the dumplings in a single layer. Let cook for 1-2 minutes or until the bottoms are golden, then pour about 1/4 cup of water into the pan and immediately cover to capture the steam. Let the dumplings steam about 1-2 minutes or until tender.",
				"7. Serve warm with dumpling dipping sauce."

				"Nice recipe but i wanted to mention that your &#8220;classic&#8221; wonton shape, while perfectly functional, is not the real wonton shape. For real chinese wontons you place teaspoon of filling just above one corner of wrapper, fold corner over filling, roll to tuck point under. Moisten two side corners and pull them together behind filled corner and overlap slightly, pinch together to seal. This leaves a nice floaty little tail. Takes a little practice but just as easy once you get the hang of it. Of course you can also just pinch corner to corner for a triangle shape before sticking ends together or stick with the rectangle shape like youve done. In the end the only things that really matter are that they taste delicious and are cruelty free!",
				"So amazing! We had some leftover wonton wrappers and needed to use them up, and since then they&#8217;ve been a staple. We added maybe 5x the amount of scallions because we&#8217;re fiends for the stuff. We pan fried then steamed for the crunch and chew and OMG.",
				"Delicious!!  I haven\u2019t had wonton soup in years and now I\u2019m so happy to have a vegan recipe for the wontons I remember from chinese restaurants before I went vegan!  I froze the rest of the batch and plan to test a few in the air fryer later this week- I will update with the results.  Thank you Eva!",
				"The vegan wontons were very delicious. I added more ginger, a lot more, because I love ginger. But other than that the recipe was delicious and easy to follow. Thank you!"

			"serving": "6 pancakes",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Mix the flour and salt together for the dough, pour in the boiling hot water and mix together with chopsticks or a wooden spoon to make a dough. Then, knead the dough using a stand mixer (if kneading by hand let cool enough to handle without burning yourself) for 5-8 minutes to make a supple and slightly tacky dough.",
				"2. Oil a mixing bowl and place the dough ball in the bowl, turning to coat the dough with oil. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but ideally 1-2 hours. Alternatively, wrap dough in plastic and place in fridge to rest overnight.",
				"3. When ready to shape the pancakes, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using in a small dish. Carefully add the hot oil and stir together.",
				"4. Lightly oil a silicon mat or a clean countertop and turn out the dough. Divide into 6 pieces, and place them back in their covered bowl or under a damp towel.",
				"5. Take out one piece of dough at a time and roll until the dough is thin into large rectangle shape. Brush the dough with the flour-oil mixture and sprinkle with sliced scallions.",
				"6. Roll the long edge of the dough over the scallions to make a rope, then roll the rope starting at one end to make a spiral shape. Tuck the second end of the rope under the spiral to hold it in place.",
				"7. Flatten the spiral with your hand to make a disk, then roll out until the pancake is about 6-7\" in diameter. Place the rolled pancake on parchment paper and top with a second piece of parchment paper. Repeat the shaping with the remaining pieces of dough. You can stack the shaped pancakes, sandwiching them between parchment paper.",
				"8. To cook the pancakes: heat a skillet (two to make it go faster) or griddle over medium heat. Add a layer of oil and once hot fry the pancakes. Cook the pancakes 3-5 minutes on each side, flipping as needed to keep them from burning (turn down the heat if cooking too fast). Add more oil or use a silicon brush to push the oil back into the center as needed.",
				"9. Place the cooked pancakes on a paper towel lined plate or cooling rack and let rest for a few minutes before eating!"

				"Thank you for this recipe, Eva!  This is the best chili I&#8217;ve made, vegan or not.  You&#8217;re right, the tvp adds A LOT. I try to keep my meals lower-sodium so I used lower-sodium crushed tomatoes, and home-made no-salt beans.\nI&#8217;ve eaten this chili so far once topped with sauerkraut, and once topped with tofutti. Hard to tell which I liked better. \ud83d\ude42\nMy mom and my kids (6, 6, and 9 yrs old) love this recipe too!",
				"I didn&#8217;t have pinto beans so I used one can each of red kidney, white cannellini, black eyed peas and black beans. I also threw in an extra tbsp of cocoa just because I thought the flavour would be interesting as well as some frozen corn which was on the cusp of freezer burn (didn&#8217;t want to toss it)\nI hadn&#8217;t noticed that ran out of chili powder and the shops were closed, so I subbed with two tsp of Sambal Oelek (Indonesian chili paste). It surprised me how good it tastes!. Managed to get 9-500 ml jars from this recipe, so there&#8217;s a goodly number of frozen meals for me. I&#8217;m trying to eat no to very low oil, so only using 1 tbsp of oil to cook the onions and garlic was fine with me. \nOverall I&#8217;d give this two spoons up!! DELICIOUS!",
				"absolutely delicious! it even fooled my meat lover son!! but how do I cut the spice for my vegan daughter???",

			"serving": "2 15 oz dough balls or 3 10oz dough balls",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Measure out the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add in the salt and stir to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let sit for a couple of minutes to hydrate and dissolve, then stir to distribute.",
				"2. Add the flour into the mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until you form a shaggy dough. Switch to using your hands. Wet your hands to prevent the dough from sticking to them and pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then reach under the edges of the dough and gently pull it up to stretch the dough until you hit resistance, then fold the section of dough over to rest of the dough. Turn the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat the pulling and folding until you've gone all around. This action brings the dough back into one piece. Repeat the pinching and folding process for about 1-2 minutes until your dough starts to turn into a cohesive, but sticky ball of dough. Re-wet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to them. Cover the bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.",
				"3. After the 20 minutes of rest, turn the dough onto a clean and floured surface. Knead the dough for about 1 minute until you get a smooth ball of dough. Flour your hands and add flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil and place the ball of dough mixing bowl, turning to coat in oil before leaving seam side down. Cover the mixing bowl and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, until it's doubled in size. You can let it rise for up to 2 hours before shaping.",
				"4. Turn the dough onto a clean, floured counter and stretch to make a large rectangle. You're going to divide the dough into 2 or 3 pieces (depending on the size you want your final pizza to be) by sprinkling flour over where you're going to cut (this prevents it from sticking) and cut into the sections with a bench scraper, or with a butter knife by pressing straight down into the dough.",
				"5. Shape the dough one piece at a time. To shape the dough, you will use the same folding technique as before (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball. Then, turn the ball of dough and place seam side down on a clean, un-floured section of the counter. Cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Repeat with the remaining sections of dough, then place on a floured plate. Sprinkle more flour on top of the dough, then cover with plastic wrap and place the plate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or up to 72 hours, before making pizza.",
				"6. Before shaping the dough and baking, let come to room temperature and relax for about 1 hour. If you try to shape the dough and it's not stretching out easily or quickly, let it rest for 10 minutes then try again."

				"@Taylor Dent, \nCooking pizza with cast iron is epic. When using cast iron you usually want to use a dutch oven, that is have a lid that can absorb heat as well.\nmy suggestion is to heat the cast iron first and with a peel drop the pizza into the pan so you can use the heat of the pan to do the cooking, and, make it well covered with a lid of some sort, any pan / lid is better than foil and it should work well.",
				"@thecuriouschickpea, \nFreezing dough happens after the final proofing. When you thaw it out it will be ready to shape and use.",
				"@Tony, \nUnless you are using a brick yeast, rapid rise is perfectly fine. The difference is you just do not need to proof it first.",
				"Hi Eva,\nThank you for the recipe! This was my first time making pizza dough. It turned out great! Can&#8217;t wait to do it again&#8230;\nCouple questions though. At any time do I need to punch the dough down? Not sure why even. Lol. And can I add seasonings to the dough?\nThank you,\nJohn",
				"Hello and thank you for the recipe.  Can I make a whole wheat version of this?",
				"@Gary Hewett &#8212; Gary is the epitome of a male Karen.",
				"@Eva Agha, I believe the only difference between instant and active yeast is that instant yeast has smaller granules with some yeast activator. This allows you to add it directly to the dough. If you follow the directions on your active yeast (add to water and wait) then you should get the same result as if you had used instant yeast.",
				"I followed this recipe carefully yesterday and it turned out perfectly!\nI made a half recipe and let it sit in my fridge for the minimum 6 hours. My dough sat perfectly in my 12 inch pizza pan.\nIt was simple, easy, and satisfying! I will definitely be making this again. Maybe for some calzones..  \ud83d\ude42\nThank you!",
				"@Meghan White, I did not mean to write this in caps!! also I am not comfortable having my email posted here publicly, can you please remove this?",
				"WHAT BIZZAR DIRECTION, I WISH I READ STEP TWO BEFORE STARTING THIS RECIPE. YOUR &#8216;PINCHING&#8217; TECHNIQUE IS CONFUSING AND AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION. IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE SUCH BIZAR DOUGH MAKING DIRECTIONS I RECOMMEND POSTING MORE PICTURES OF THE PROCESS&#8230;",
				"I just attempted this recipe. When I go to reach my hands into the bowl after first mixing with a wooden spoon, my hands get covered in dough &#8211; despite wetting them thoroughly first. I weighed out the flour according to your recipe and double checked the water amount but it seems insanely wet. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to be able to knead this without adding a bunch more flour in. What am I doing wrong?",
				"This recipe was perfect! Thank you for explaining the importance of extra hydration for pizza going into a home oven as opposed to a high heat pizza or commercial oven. Also thanks for the tips on the pizza peel. I do. It have a peel but I applied the same principles to a flat baking sheet and it worked wonderfully. We divided the pizza dough in 2, made one large pizza for the 2 of us and froze the second for another time, and I can\u2019t wait! Literally so excited over this recipe",
				"Hello, \nI just wanted to know if I could do the kneading using a stand mixer? \nThank you!!",
				"@Eva Agha, yay! Thanks so much for responding so quickly!",
				"Hi I hope you see this tonight and are able to comment back. I was planning on using this recipe and just skimmed through for the ingredients at the store. Then I started reading everything when I got home and saw where it said this is a wetter dough because it\u2019s made for an oven and longer cooking time. I am making this for my dad\u2019s house tomorrow and he has an outdoor brick oven. So this will only be cooked about 1-3 minutes at around 800 degrees. Will this still work!? Thank you!",
				"I understand this is an old post and you may not see this but I\u2019m gonna ask anyway\u2026 Do you have a video or pictures steps to describe the pinching and pulling that seem to be a required step? I can\u2019t seem to figure out what you mean! Or perhaps you know of another similar recipe that already has a video?",
				"I know sugar is not needed but I tend to like a touch of sweetness. Can I add a pinch of sugar or will it throw off the rising process? And if it&#8217;s ok to add, when and how much for the touch of sweetness",
				"Just to confirm, do you freeze it after letting it sit in the fridge overnight, or before that?",
				"Hi, I was making a half batch, but I can&#8217;t achieve the smooth dough with 2 cup all purpose and 3/4 water. Should I add more water?",
				"Wow!  What an arrogant jerk you are sir!!!!\nBloody hell!",
				"Question about fridge storing. I left the dough in the fridge for 3 days because&#8230; Reasons. I pinched it down once during the 3 days. On day 3 I took it out and I noticed a sour odor and a small amount of hootch like a sourdough starter. Has this happened to you and did you still use the dough?",
				"Oh man, this recipe was a total dud for me! I&#8217;m posting in hopes anyone has some advice.\nI have been making a lot of homemade pizza since March and they have all turned out amazing but this is the first overnight dough i have made and it was awful, so if anyone who hasnt tried making this yet is reading it, please beware. \nThis recipe seemed doomed from the start, are the water and flour ratios correct? When I put in 1.5cups water and FOUR cups of flour it was just a hard lumpy mass. Literally unkneadable, and looked nothing like the nice wet slack dough in the video. I triple read the instructions after to make sure I didn&#8217;t misread anything but alas, that is in fact the ratio. Just to get the dough to a kneadable state, i had to basically double the water amount. I had a feeling from this time that it was in trouble but i still followed all the instructions and wait times just in case a miracle happened (it did not).\nAfter the overnight rise, when i took the dough ball out it wasnt a cohesive dough, you could clearly separate the dough from where i folded it onto itself from the day before (again, i think the dough was too dry despite my extra water). After priming my oven, i stretch the dough, topped it, and baked.\nThe pizza was edible, but the dough was just so dense and hard and didnt rise very much at all. I may try and make it again just to see but I also dont want to waste ingredients. \nI did double check my measurements and this has never been a problem for me with any of the other multiple recipes i have used.",
				"Hi!\nI\u2019ve been no the hunt to make the perfect pizza dough, so I\u2019m very excited to try this recipe! I don\u2019t have instant yeast, only Red Star Active Dry Yeast. How would you recommend I modify this recipe until I can get instant yeast?\nThank you.",
				"Could you add olive oil to this dough recipe please?",
				"Hi I\u2019m looking to prepare pizza bases ahead of a party for around 30 people, say 50 individual 9 inch pizzas?\nWhat would you recommend to limit work on the day? Can I \u2018roll\u2019 or stretch the bases the day before and keep refrigerated- would I put these on greaseproof paper/keep them oiled?\nWe will be using our outdoor kitchen to cook &#8211; a kamado BBQ and a dedicated wood burning pizza oven with stone &#8211; any tips to ensure a thin crust that doesn\u2019t stick?\nWe plan to practise loads in the time running up to it &#8211; do you have a video that goes long with this recipe? Thanks \ud83d\ude42",
				"Gary Hewett&#8217;s recipe can&#8217;t be all that great if he&#8217;s looking for a new and improved dough recipe. I have just popped my dough in the fridge for tomorrow night. Thank you for the recipe,and advice.",
				"Hello, will this dough work with wholewheat flour?",
				"Hi! What would be the measure for a homemade natural yeast?\nAnd also you don\u2019t add olive oil or sugar to the beginning of the dough right?\nTkss",

				"do you pre bake the dough before adding the toppings and sauce? and how long should i bake the pizza for ?",
				"I am planning to try this recipe later this week. Should I use the convection function or regular? Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
				"I found my house was a bit cold for the yeast to rise I think &#8211; after 2 hours it hadn&#8217;t done much. I heated my oven to 105f, turned it off, and stuck my covered bowl in and voila &#8211; an hour later I had lots of rise!",
				"Oops! Wrote this in the review!\nAbsolutely loved the dough! I made the exact recipe and made two dough balls. We had one tonight and the other one we want to save to make two calzones. If so, would you recommend cooking at the same time as the pizza, 550? Anyways, delicious recipe. Thank you!!!",
				"All I have on hand is rapid rise yeast. Could I lower the amount of yeast, let\u2019s say 1/8  Tsp. Of rapids rise since that\u2019s all I have on hand for this recipe. I can\u2019t get my hands a regular yeast. they are sold out everywhere because of covid-19 lockdown. Thank you, stay safe and god bless!!",
				"I like to use fresh ground flour, do you have any suggestions for variations using fresh ground hard winter wheat?  I also live in Colorado so higher hydration in dough is essential, otherwise the water evaporates during the rise and doughs are too dry.  Thank you for any tips! I will be making this dough for family pizza dinner for Easter!!  The kids all get to top their own pizza.",
				"My sourdough starter is having an off day so I tried out this recipe instead! However I used fresh yeast..  hope this doesn&#8217;t upset the recipe too much. \nThe dough seems incredibly wet though and I can&#8217;t stop it sticking all over my hands resulting in dough covered flour bags!\nI&#8217;m now waiting for  an hour for it to rise before shaping it into 3 then leaving in the fridge for dinner tomorrow.  I hope it will be a bit more manageable! \nWish me luck! \ud83d\ude00",
				"Is there any way to substitute an ingredient for yeast?  Don&#8217;t have any on hand in my pantry.",
				"Trying my hand at this now, I wish there were more pictures for each step. I make bread a lot, but this is my first time making pizza dough. How much of a rise should I be expecting? For bread it&#8217;s very visible, but so far I don&#8217;t see much of anything with my dough. Right now I&#8217;m at the 1-2 hour bulk fermentation. \nAlso, when putting the balls into the fridge, will they stay in balls or kind of flatten out? Will the continue to rise while in the fridge? I&#8217;m trying to figure out the best way to do it because I made 3 batches so I will have a total of 6 balls. It seems easier to put them all onto a floured baking sheet rather than 6 plates, but I don&#8217;t want to do that and then have them all flatten out and lump together.. What are your thoughts? Thanks!",
				"My dough has not risen at all.",
				"I had great success with this, especially with a steel. I&#8217;m making it again, but I still don&#8217;t quite understand the &#8220;shaping the dough&#8221; step. I don&#8217;t know what shape I&#8217;m supposed to end up with when storing it for a few days. Am I stretching it then reforming to a ball? \nAlso do you think you could freeze this?",
				"Wow, I&#8217;m astonished that someone would be so rude!",
				"Gary,\n    Your critique is as bad as your parent&#8217;s failure to raise a kind and intelligent human being. Please kindly return to what ever troll cave you were born in and stay away from us humans, thanks.",
				"As someone that is an accomplished pizza-bread maker, I tried the overnight pizza dough recipe to see how it stacked up against my regular dough and was fully underwhelmed. I can only assume the worst, such as that, these amazed at the results of overnight pizza dough makers are the same people that make up the contestants on the Americas Worst Cooks show! I was up for a new and improved dough recipe but this wasn&#8217;t it. I can do much better with my regular method in a few hours.It had very little to recommend as an improvement, 1 item actually. The dough was pliable and easy to work, but had no flavor to add to the finished pizza! Certainly not worth the added effort. Get a Pizza stone an a oven that will hold 500 degrees, for your best shot at it. An additional issue might be that low expectations!!!",
				"Your pizza dough looks absolutely perfect. Will have to give this a try.",
				"Can you use all purpose gluten free flour?  I have not perfected a gf pizza . Yet",
				"What vegan cheese did you use for this pizza?",
				"I\u2019m planning to make a large batch for a party and had few questions. When making a large batch of dough , did you do any additional kneading before bulk fermentation, or just put the dough in fridge? Did you shape the balls the day you make pizzas and use it immediately or did you let it warm  up and ferment some more before shaping?",
				"I agree. I search and search and wish I could find this exact kind of recipe (slow rise/ferment in the fridge) but just want a yield of one pizza. It obviously saves time to make a big batch but I can&#8217;t get through three pizzas in as many days and I&#8217;ve had rotten luck with freezing and defrosting pizza dough.",
				"I wish this recipe instructed on the amount of ingredients for just one pizza. I don&#8217;t want or need multiple doughs.",
				"I was planning to make pizza for a party of around 50 freinds and needed to make the dough a day before. Found this recipe and it was perfect. I made *10 the quantity in one batch, which was tough, but made around 15-18 14&#8243; pizzas (I lost count) In a steel pizza oven. I didn&#8217;t separate the dough into individual pizzas before hand because of the quantity, instead I kept it in 2 halfs in large bags with plenty oil, which was fine. The dough was the best I have made and everyone at the party went crazy for it, so much air in the crust. The main plus of this is how good it tastes and that thin or thick crust are both delicious, which is not always th case (with some recipes favouring thin or thick). From now on this will be my go to recipe. Thanks a lot for making the part a success. Wish I could share photos.",
				"This was wonderful! We made a deep dish and two thins with the recipe. No one knew it was a vegan recipe until I told them. The instructions were easy to follow and the taste was fantastic. Thank you for helping this journey of a new lifestyle (no dairy and no eggs) be one that is easier to do than I thought.",
				"Thanks for the recipe!\nI am planning to prepare dough for 10 people, each having their own 10&#8243; pizza. Would you recommend tripling the recipe to fit this quantity?\nI will also be cooking these over campfire coals in cast iron pans, oiled, and covered with aluminum foil. I was planning to use the high heat of direct contact with the coals and to cook for about 5 minutes. Do you have any insight into how I may best achieve thoroughly cooked dough?\nThanks again!",
				"Hi! Can you freeze the dough if you dont use it all?",
				"We do pizza every Friday so I can&#8217;t wait to try this out! It looks so easy!",
				"Great recipe? Have you tried using bread flour?",
				"I rarely review recipes, but I made this on Tuesday night, so that Wednesday evening I&#8217;d have a simple meal ready to go. I loved this crust, and mind you I did not follow the recipe perfectly, nor did I have the peel nor the stone. I just used a square small baking sheet, oiled it up, topped it and baked it. The crust was nicely crisped, with lovely coloring and such a nice flavor. I&#8217;ve made a lot of pizza dough recipes, but this one worked great with the limitations I had. AND THANK YOU for posting grams. I much prefer to make dough by weight instead of volume. \nAlso can I just mention how much I love pizza for using up the scraps? I had a cup of homemade spaghetti sauce left, which turned into pizza sauce. Some leftover shredded chicken, from the stock I had made for chicken noodle soup. And some languishing spinach in my fridge. One pizza was turned into bbq chicken + pineapple pizza. The other was spinach and anchovy.",
				"1/4 tsp of instant yeast? Seems very low. No sugar?",
				"..FLOUR&#8230;LOL?",
				"&#8230; have you ever used active sourdough starter in this pizza dough and can I use bread flower I also have double zero from Italy that&#8217;s actually made for pizza have a great night..!!?????"

			"recipe": [
				"1. Prepare the dumpling dough: in a stand mixer bowl combine the flour, salt, oil, and boiling hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine bring into a rough dough. Using the dough hook on a stand mixer knead on low speed for 3 minutes, turn off and let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3 minutes on low speed. ",
				"2. Turn out onto the counter and knead by hand for about 1 minute and make any last adjustments with flour or water to make a smooth and supple dough that's slightly tacky (but not sticky) to the touch. Cover with a damp towel and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes while you prepare the filling. Alternatively you can knead by hand, just let the dough cool enough to not burn your hands and follow the same knead 3m, rest 5m, knead 3m pattern, making adjustments with flour as you knead.",
				"3. Prepare the filling: Heat a skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and add the tofu. Fry for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cabbage, green onion, garlic, plus a pinch of salt and let cook 5-6 minutes until the cabbage has released its water and the mixture has cooked down.",
				"4. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the gochujang paste, hot water, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to form a smooth sauce. Add the sauce to the tofu mixture along with the cilantro, stir to combine then turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. You can transfer to a plate and put in fridge to speed up the process.",
				"5. Fill and shape the dumplings: Divide the rested dumpling dough into 32 pieces: cut in half, then each half into quarters, and each quarter into quarters to get 32. Keep them covered under the damp towel in the bowl, working with just a few at a time.",
				"6. Lightly dust the counter and roll out each piece of dough individually to make a thin circle, about the size of your palm. Using your finger or a pastry brush, brush a little water just around the edge of the circle, about 1cm thick. Put the wrapper in one hand, and place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper. With your other hand fold the wrapper in half and pinch in the center so it seals, then working towards the edge, pleat one side and press to seal against the opposite side, then work down the other side. You can also create folds starting from one edge and working to the others so that all the pleats fold in the same direction, but this method is a bit more challenging for a beginner. Set aside onto a piece of parchment paper and repeat with remaining pieces of dough.",
				"7. When the dumplings are all shaped, put a thin layer of water in a bowl and pour sesame seeds to cover a small plate. Dip the dumplings in the water then dip into the sesame seeds (this step is optional) and return to the parchment paper.",
				"8. Cook the dumplings: heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or so of oil to coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Add dumplings in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Let cook for about 2 minutes, then add 1/4 cup of water (be careful of splattering, hold a lid up to protect you as you pour) and immediately cover the skillet. Let steam for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and if the bottoms are still too light in color, let them continue to cook until golden.",
				"9. Repeat with second and if needed, third batch of dumplings and eat while hot!"

				"Do you have a recipe for a gluten-free dumpling dough?",
				"I saw gochujang at my grocery store, Sempio brand which is based in Korea, it was packaged in a red tub like the product you linked to on Amazon above, but the package said sweet and spicy sauce. I forgot to check the ingredient list but do you think what is inside the red tub is more paste-like rather than sauce-like??????",
				"I made these and they were amazing!  I made a little dipping sauce as well and a carrot daikon salad.  Very big hit.  I did purchase vegan wontons to save some time.  Can&#8217;t wait to make them again.  I&#8217;m actually craving them as I write this.  We got 30 dumplings from the recipe.  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!"

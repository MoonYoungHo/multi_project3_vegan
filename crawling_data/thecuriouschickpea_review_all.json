Plus it&#8217;s easy to prepare, even with homemade gnocchi &#8212; the biggest challenge was remembering to bake the potatoes ahead of time.",

				"Oooh this is like all my favorite things in one *drooool* Can you make this in one large casserole dish rather than the individual ramekins? If so how big should it be?",
				"I often use sunflower seeds in place of cashews, it gives a very similar result!",
				"Hello! I love this and have shared with a friend. She is allergic to c.oil. What would you sub for in the mozzarella sauce? Thank you!",
				"Just made this and my kids and loved it. Thankyou! Just wondering, do you think the cheese is freezable? I have HEAPS leftover",
				"Just made this the other day and it&#8217;s really good! I used jarred sauce so I can&#8217;t speak to the sauce recipe. Funny, I was a little worried I&#8217;d done the mozzarella wrong because it was liquid, and I thought it would just mix into the gnocchi and make a mess, but it worked perfectly! I could taste the coconut oil a little bit, but I didn&#8217;t use refined coconut oil which I think would make all the difference in the world. Thanks for this recipe!",
				"I&#8217;m going to give this a shot. It looks fantastic!\nHowever, I&#8217;m wondering if there is an alternative to the cashews for the mozz sauce? I am deathly allergic to all nuts&#8230;and I have yet to find a vegan cheese that actually is stretchy AND tastes good. Being new to eating this way, and being a huge cheese lover previously, it is the one thing I miss from &#8220;the Before&#8221;.",

				"1. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. In a second small mixing bowl combine the yogurt, melted vegan butter (or coconut oil), and warm water until smooth. Add the wet to the dry and combine with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough.",
				"2. Knead with your hands for about 1-2 minutes. The dough will be very sticky, if it feels soupy, add a bit more flour until it's sticky but not runny. Otherwise, you can wet your hands to prevent the dough from sticking too much.",
				"3. Shape the kneaded dough into a ball and turn seam-side down. Cover the bowl and place it in a warm spot. Let the dough rise 45 minutes or until swollen 1 1/2 - 2x in size. Alternatively, refrigerate the dough after kneading in a covered mixing bowl and continue 8-48 hours later.",
				"4. Dust a clean counter with flour and turn the proved dough out. Divide the dough into 4 to 8 equal pieces and shape into balls, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Set the dough balls on a floured plate, and sprinkle more flour on top. Cover with a lint free towel and let rise while the oven preheats.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 550 \u00baF, or as hot as your oven goes with a rack positioned 1/3 of the way down from the top of the oven. If you have one, place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack to preheat. Let the oven preheat for at least 45 minutes to saturate the sides and baking steel or stone (if using) with heat.",
				"6. After the second rise, roll the dough with a rolling pin to shape into an oval. To make a teardrop shape grab one side of the oval and stretch it to make a triangular shape.",
				"7. Brush the top of the shaped breads with melted butter (or coconut oil) and sprinkle on minced garlic if making garlic naan.",
				"8. Bake the naan 2-3 at a time, either on a parchment lined baking tray or directly on a baking stone or steel. If baking on the stone or steel transfer using a pizza peel.",
				"9. Bake for 3-5 minutes until there are some golden spots on the bubbled surface. If desired, turn on the broiler for 1-2 minutes after 3-4 minutes of baking. Larger naan will take longer to cook, smaller ones will cook faster, keep an eye on the first batch and adjust cooking times accordingly.",
				"10. Repeat with remaining dough. For restaurant style presentation, brush the hot dough with some more vegan butter, the butter will melt on contact. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve."

				"When I made this naan, I found out I was completely out of salt! I tried subbing 2 tsp of very salty mushroom powder and wound up with such a delicious umami flavor. I couldn&#8217;t get enough! Figured I&#8217;d note that here in case anyone else wants to try adding mushroom powder to their naan as well.",
				"This naan was excellent! Everyone loved it. It was so soft and tender. I really like that you use weight for baking, it makes me more confident your recipes are going to work. Thanks so much for sharing!",
				"Can this Naan recipe be made with gluten free flour?",
				"I have a question! We have a pizza stone and a barbecue, and sometimes make Italian pizza in the barbecue (it&#8217;s made by high heat and the pizza cooks in a couple of minutes &#8211; it&#8217;s how they do it there). Can I use the barbecue in the same way to cook the naan? Thank you!",
				"Obviously submitted before reading.  That should be *lakanto",
				"I omitted the oil and used lake to monkfruit sweetener in place of the sugar. It still turned out amazing. Thank",
				"Do you flip it while baking?",
				"Hi, thank you for the recipe. This Naan was so easy to make &amp; so delicious, airy &amp; flavourful. I made my dough yesterday, using coconut plain yogurt, as it was the only vegan yogurt in my supermarket (very small rural town). I put it into the fridge overnight  &amp; rolled it out &amp; cooked it tonight on a pizza stone.\nI doubled the recipe because I am taking them to work tomorrow (I am catering a work luncheon for 13 people). I made some large &amp; some small (the small ones are perfect for scooping up the red lentil curry &amp; the sweet potato, chickpea &amp; spinach Dahl I\u2019ve made as well) I can\u2019t wait to get feed back from my work colleagues.\nCheers from Australia",
				"This turned out great! I didn&#8217;t have enough yogurt to do 1 full cup so I inverted the measurements for water and yogurt (1/2 cup instead) and it worked out perfectly. So pillowy! I let it rise/ferment in the fridge overnight. I also pan-fried them on a cast iron rather than heating up my oven.",
				"Well, since I was completely blind to the fact that you included measurements by weight, it seems clear that it&#8217;s me who made some kind of big mistake! I guess I&#8217;m just jealous that everyone else seemed to have made it with such wonderful results \ud83d\ude41\nThe bread turned out, but it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;flatbread&#8221; than naan. I&#8217;ll try again &#8211; thanks for the great recipes!!",
				"Yes, I measured and used white flour. I measured by volume, as there was no weight indicated in the recipe. I did whisk the dry ingredients together as per the recipe. The yogurt was not thick/greek yogurt &#8211; I easily poured it into my measuring cup. The only thing I can imagine is that I zoned out while adding the flour and added an extra cup &#8211; it&#8217;s the only thing that makes sense, regardless of how nonsensical it sounds \ud83d\ude42\nI&#8217;ll be baking the bread shortly, and I&#8217;m sure it will work out well with the extra water I added.\nThanks for getting back to me.",
				"I&#8217;ve just prepared this dough as per this recipe, adding the 1 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup warm water and 3 T melted butter. It is SO dry! I can&#8217;t believe that you achieved the sticky, moist dough in your pictures and in your directions with only this amount of liquids. Is it possible you&#8217;ve made a mistake? I had to add at least another 1/2 cup of water just to get this dough anywhere near the pictures and your description. Please clarify &#8211; thanks!",
				"Hey! My naan tasted great but I think I still must have done something wrong. I don&#8217;t have a stone so I used the baking sheet with parchment paper method, the oven was at 500 degrees (the highest mine will go) and it melted the wax paper and stuck to the naan. Also the naan burned at its thinest most stretched out parts &#8211; so maybe I wouldn&#8217;t stretch it so thin next time? I don&#8217;t know. I had better luck making a non-vegan naan recipe, but I would really like to make this recipe right. To start, I think I&#8217;ll try not using any parchment paper next time.",
				"Dear Eva,\nFirst time trying to make naan and I\u2019m so lucky to chanced ipon your recipe. It worked beautifully! I don\u2019t have an oven so I pan fry it and the result is crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside! Its so Super delicious! I\u2019ll definitely make it again and again! Even thinking of using it as a pizza base (but pan fried style) ? Thank you, Eva!\nCheers!\nLynda",
				"For some reason the dough didn\u2019t rise, I followed the instructions properly. Any chance the yeast is supposed to be out in water and added to wet ingredients instead?",
				"Hello Eva,\nCan this Naan be made with any gluten free flour? Chickpea flour? \nBest regards,\nPaige",
				"I&#8217;m about to try this with sweetened almond milk yogurt&#8230;.only because it&#8217;s all i have and I think a critical part of richner naan. I am noticing sugar is added in recipe anyway, albeit possibly less than what&#8217;s in the yogurt I have&#8230;.I hope this doesn&#8217;t result in a sweet naan!",
				"This is an amazing naan recipe, thank you! Non-vegan husband who loves restaurant naan absolutely loved this, and so did I!",
				"This is a flawless recipe! Delicious to the core! Thank you so much!",
				"Correction: What yogurt did you use in your naan?",
				"Hello,\nI would love to make your naan.  However, I went from vegetarian to vegan and omitted all dairy.  Do have a replacement for yogurt?",
				"This naan looks amazing, Eva &#8211; I&#8217;ll have to try my hand at making it! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Your recipes and photos are just beautiful!",
				"Holy deliciousness, Eva!  This naan is so amazing (as are all your recipes!).  I&#8217;ve made it twice now &#8211; it&#8217;s so easy, pillowy soft in the middle with a beautiful crust on the outside.  My family goes CRAZY for this naan, they gobble every single piece down and there are never any leftovers (much to my chagrin)."

				"Hello Eva, I made this today and it is pure heaven. I\u2019ve made caramel sauce and toffee before but that was when I was a vegetarian and using dairy. So great to be able to make a vegan version. I did make a mistake and used coconut cream from a fridged can of coconut milk \ud83d\ude02. I realised this as it was cooling down. So in fact I made toffee \ud83d\ude01. But I just added some oat milk and it is right as rain. Thank you for your lovely recipe. x",

In love with that \u201cmozzarella\u201d sauce, so easy and quick to make:)) I didn\u2019t have vegan sausage crumbles on hand so I just used finely chopped cremini mushroom, red bell pepper, broccoli stems along with roughly smashed left over lentils. This will be now my new go to dish for entertaining. Thanks!!",
				"This is the best baked ziti recipe ever! I make this with a roasted red pepper sauce and impossible meat and my non vegan family is obsessed with it! Sometimes I add spinach &amp; mushrooms too, but it\u2019s so good even on its own. I\u2019m making it this week for the maybe 6th time and I\u2019m so excited to have it again!",
				"I baked a half batch of this in the air fryer for 15 minutes and it came out wonderfully! Thank you!",
				"I\u2019ve never made a vegan dish before, let alone one so involved!! Stayed up very late making it and had to improvise a few times, but I had a blast. It turned out beautiful and I hope the recipient enjoys it!! Thanks so much for sharing.",
				"What would you suggest me using instead of the canned whole toms if I don&#8217;t have a blender to blend the whole tomatoes?",
				"Hi there, I made this recipe today (looks so good!) and I have a question about the cheese sauce. I used a vitamix with all the ingredients as listed (tapioca flour that was labeled as \u201calso called tapioca starch\u201d), but mine looks a lot thicker than your pics. What did I do wrong? I haven\u2019t baked it yet so I don\u2019t know about the taste.",

My boyfriend and I sometimes make it as often as once a week and it is always my go to when I have meat eaters/non-vegans over and they are always so impressed! The mozzarella sauce is amazing and it thickens up so much in the oven. Absolutely love it and it is no joke one of my favorite recipes!",

				"I really want to make this but I genuinely cannot find refined coconut oil anywhere anymore &#8211; I used to rely on it so heavily for baking, but for the last year it seems like everywhere no longer stocks it, which has thrown me for a loop.

I\u2019m sure that if it is anything like the mozzarella it is awesome.  I doubled the recipe and fed 4 non vegan men , plus my self and my husband. They were in heaven and could not believe there was no cheese or meat when I told them. All had. second helping and lucky for me I still had some leftovers. I am now dreaming of vegan meatball sandwiches with that amazing mozzarella sauce.",
				"I LOVE this recipe! It\u2019s been a hit with my non-vegan family (including my Italian grandma)!\nI skip the oil in the cheese sauce and I\u2019ve been skipping the sausage. I love using San Marzano tomatoes. I didn\u2019t find it necessary to put them through the food processor, I just break them up a bit with the spatula as they cook.\nLast night was my 4th time making it, it was a double batch and everyone got seconds! Thank you!",
				"I&#8217;ve made this twice now! I dont normally have coconut oil on hand but I&#8217;ve made it substituting once with olive oil and the other time with a vegan butter stick! The butter stick version is out of this world. My boyfriend asked if we could use it as an alfredo sauce next. (And he still eats dairy!) Thank you for this amazing recipe.",
				"I bought regular tapioca pearls and i ground them up in my blender.",
				"Hi!!! I am brand new to your website and i am so glad i found you! I want to make this soon but i. Was wondering if i could use vegetable oil instead of the coconut oil?",
				"I made this tonight. It was surprisingly easy and delicious!",
				"Hi. this looks great.  Would I be able to freeze and reheat to make ahead?",
				"I made a \u201ctest run\u201d today and made this in a 3qt dish for my non-vegan family since I\u2019m planning on making it for a friendsgiving tomorrow and they LOVED it. One question though!! How long would you suggest I bake it for if I\u2019m planning on making it in a 4 or 5qt casserole dish? I saw that you also used a 3qt in your pictures, so should I double the recipe?",
				"I\u2019ve used your recipe to make this twice now and it is unbelievable!  Hard to believe something so easy to make is sooooooooo tasty.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it\u2019s a firm family favourite and I\u2019m looking forward to serving it at an upcoming dinner party.  Must admit I\u2019ve never had a non-vegan (or even vegetarian) version but can\u2019t believe anything could match this.",
				"It looks fabulous!! I\u2019m making  it for a potluck meal at my church.",
				"Hi. I&#8217;m excited to make this,  but I don&#8217;t have tapioca starch. Can I sub vital wheat gluten?\nThanks",
				"Absolutely delicious! My toddler polished off every bowl I gave him for the next few days. It&#8217;s rich and decadent and filling. I used Gusta sausages (my fav) and I will make this as a &#8220;company&#8217;s coming&#8221; dish next time. Thank you!",
				"I\u2019m planning to make this dish. It looks delicious&#8230; quick (silly)question, did you cover it when putting it in the oven.\nThanks",
				"What size casserole dish did you use?",
				"Hi there, I live in the sticks and am poor \ud83d\ude00 so I used this as a base recipe but changed the &#8220;mozzarella&#8221; sauce a bit &#8211; I had neither cashews nor nutritional yeast \ud83d\ude41 so made a sort of white sauce with some precious vegan grated &#8220;cheese&#8221; and it is now in the oven, baking and looking pretty promising \ud83d\ude42 Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",
				"I am not a cook but reading how easy this recipe is I made it without using my family as guinea pigs. It was delicious, everyone loved it, even meat eaters. I love garlic so I added extra fresh garlic, no powder. I also used soy meatballs instead. Thank you for this recipe. I will now try other recipes.",
				"Does this freeze well?  I&#8217;d like to make it ahead of time and freeze for vacation.",
				"Hey! Wanna make this recipe but don\u2019t have access to tapioca starch where I live. Would it be ok to sub with cornstarch instead??  Thanks",
				"If I don&#8217;t have the nutritional yeast for the sauce will it be ok? I have some vegan cheese shreds I could substitute?",
				"I used gardein crumbles and a lot more nooch (I can never get enough lol), added some veggies to the sauce. So good! It really is the cashew cheese that makes it totally out of this world. Thank you for sharing this recipe! Such a hit!!",
				"Great&#8230;.I will report back!",
				"This looks so so so good&#8230;..would the recipe work without the oil for the mozzerella?",
				"Yum! I love adding sausage to pasta dishes, I just wish we could buy seitan sausages here! Can\u2019t wait to try it!"

				"1 lb extra firm or super firm tofu",
				"6 tbsp cornstarch, arrowroot, or tapioca starch",
				"1/4 cup plant milk",
				"1 cup panko style bread crumbs",
				"2 tbsp olive oil",
				"1/2 tsp paprika",
				"1/2 tsp salt",
				"freshly ground black pepper",
				"1 tbsp fresh minced parsley",
				"6 tbsp (90g) red cayenne pepper hot sauce, ideally Franks RedHot",
				"3 tbsp (35g) vegan butter",
				"1/8 tsp granulated garlic",
				"1/8 tsp salt",
				"Vegan bleu cheese or ranch style dressing"
			],
			"time": "50 minutes",
			"serving": "18 tofu wings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF and lightly grease a large rimmed baking sheet.",
				"2. If using extra-firm tofu press out the extra water: Slice your tofu into 6 width-wise slabs and wrap in a lint-free towel or paper towel. Place some weights over the wrapped tofu, like a heavy cast iron skillet or books atop a baking sheet. Let drain for about 20-30 minutes before continuing.",
				"3. Cut your tofu into 18 'wings' or ~1/2\" sticks. Cut the block of tofu into 6 slices width-wise if you haven't already for pressing, then slice each of those slabs into 3 slices lengthwise.",
				"4. Put the cornstarch (or arrowroot or tapioca starch) in one bowl, the plant milk in a second bowl, and mix together the bread crumb mixture in a third bowl. Pour some of the bread crumb mixture onto a plate.",
				"5. Dip each tofu 'wing' into the starch, followed by the milk, then roll in the breadcrumbs on the plate. Place the wing onto the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 'wings.' Use one hand for the starch and bread crumbs and your other for the milk to keep breading from clumping on your fingers. Add more of the breadcrumb mixture to the plate as needed.",
				"6. Bake the prepared tofu at 425 \u00baF for 25 minutes, flip, then bake an additional 10-15 minutes until the tofu wings are nice and crispy.",
				"7. While they're baking, make the buffalo sauce. Melt the vegan butter and stir in the hot sauce, granulated garlic, and salt.",
				"8. Put the tofu wings in a large mixing bowl and toss with the buffalo sauce to coat. Serve immediately.",
				"9. Leftover buffalo tofu wings can be re-crisped in the oven."

				"This is the crispiest tofu recipe I have found so far since becoming vegan over 3 years ago.    My husband works late so instead of tossing the tofu completely in Buffalo sauce and having it get soggy, I just drizzled some over the top of the Buddha bowl I made for dinner.  He can add more later if he wants.   Really great recipe!",
				"Draining tofu should be in the prep time. As should enough time to bread the tofu. Dinner will be an hour late,not that it\u2019s your problem, but this was not easy or quick.",
				"Made these last night for dinner and they are amazing!!!! Took the left overs for lunch today and almost as good. Thank you so much.",
				"I made these tofu wings last night, following the recipe as written, and my boyfriend loved them! I do not like buffalo sauce so I tossed mine in BBQ sauce and put them on a bun &#8211; it was an awesome sandwich. Thanks for sharing!",
				"I have been looking forward to making these for weeks. Today, I finally got around to it, and they were absolutely DELICIOUS!!",
				"would this still work using a medium firm tofu if i just press it beforehand for a lot longer?",
				"This is one of my favorite salads! I keep it in our regular rotation and love including it when I have anyone over who \u201cisn\u2019t in to tofu\u201d. They are always pleasantly surprised. Thank you!",
				"Wow these were incredible! Since starting my journey in Januray (now March), I&#8217;ve been craving wings so bad and now I have them muhahahaha! I would say after the initial 25 minute bake &#8211; follow-up with a 5 minute bake instead of the full 10 to avoid it being overly crispy. Otherwise 10/10 recipe!!!!!",
				"I must have done something slightly wrong. The taste was great and the breaded tofu was super crispy&#8230;until I threw them in the mixing bowl and tossed them in the sauce. They became very soggy. Still tasted great and will be good on salad, but not exactly what I was ho[ing for.",
				"These were SO good!!",
				"These are SO GOOD!! I&#8217;m a new vegetarian and was really missing buffalo wings- these are a great replacement!",
				"I&#8217;ve made these a few times now and it&#8217;s one of my favorite recipes! I&#8217;m not vegan, but I love that the tofu makes them feel a bit healthier while still keeping the Buffalo taste.",
				"Delicious! Even my daughter, who doesn\u2019t like tofu, liked it. I highly recommend trying it!",
				"Just made these&#8230; They are SOOOOOOO good!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.",
				"These are the BEST vegetarian wings I have ever had! Franks is my favorite hot sauce and I like to dip with creamy parm dip i buy at a local chain restaurant.  I don&#8217;t miss chicken at all.  Thanks for this recipe!  I look forward to trying it with mac &amp; cheese.",
				"I just made these and they were delicious! I did marinate the tofu in some sriracha, cumin, garlic powder &amp; chili powder for a few hours first but otherwise followed the recipe (except I used regular butter) and it turned out amazing!",
				"We absolutely love this recipe! I\u2019ve made it several times. Tonight we made them as recipe suggested and did avocado ones as well. \nThank you for sharing!\nThe Murphy\u2019s",
				"You can exit out of it by clicking the X button.",
				"Hey,\nThanks for a great recipe, I hope it will go down as a treat. Out of curiosity which plant milk have you tried and which do you think gives you the most consistent texture?",
				"Can I use garlic powder instead of granulated garlic?",
				"Hi! I was wondering if I could use flour instead of cornstarch? Thanks ! \ud83d\ude42",
				"I just made these last night and they are AMAZING! Seriously I ate so many!",
				"I made these for me and my husband the other night. Wow! What a winning recipe! I will he making these again for sure (maybe often;). Thank you for that recipe!",
				"This was delicious. Only thing I\u2019ll change next time is to serve the sauce on the side. I enjoyed eating them straight from the oven!",
				"This recipe is just the best. You can change up the seasonings and hot sauces and it&#8217;s still fantastic.  Can&#8217;t stop sharing it with my friends.",
				"I have never posted a review on a recipe before but this was great!! Will for sure make again. Thank you!",
				"These were a huge hit! We will definitely be using this recipe again. Lots of flavor + good texture. Other buffalo tofu recipes we\u2019ve tried have been really dull inside but this was not lacking at all.  Thanks for sharing!",
				"I didn&#8217;t have any breadcrumbs so I used oats and put them in a food processor. Weren&#8217;t crispy but I still loved it!!!!",
				"Made these tonight and they were lovely! Used regular bread crumbs, maybe not *as* crispy but still delicious! Made them in my toaster over and broiled them to crisp them up more. Dipped them in a quick home made tzatziki. I&#8217;ll definitely be making them again!\nThanks Eva, can&#8217;t wait to check out more of your recipes (:",
				"I have made these over four times. They are amazing. I\u2019m newly vegan. This recipe has  saved me. Thanks",
				"Great recipe!  Followed almost exactly but just forgot the oil!  No matter they were still crispy good.  Thank you!",
				"Just tried these vegan tofu bites. They are absolutely delicious. Ever since giving up meat buffalo chicken was one of the things that I really missed\u2026 These definitely do it for me. I made these for my husband\u2019s birthday along with some vegan mac &amp; cheese for a southern style birthday dinner. Definitely super excited for these. They will definitely be becoming part of our regular meal lineup yet. Thank you so much for this recipe",
				"I was so impressed with this recipe! It tasted so good and the texture was great. The only issue I had was I felt like they tasted too buttery, next time is probably use little to no vegan butter and just stick with dipping them in the hot sauce. I will definitely be making these again though and was still so pleased with how they turned out \ud83d\ude42",
				"I actually have the same question.  I would like to try these with tempeh, I feel like this would give it more texture.  Any feedback from someone who has tried the recipe with tempeh would be appreciated.",
				"Made exactly as directed &#8211; it was absolutely delicious!  We are definitely making this again.",
				"Definitely a late reply, but we&#8217;ve used convection bake on our air fryer to dramatically cut the cooking time on these &#8211; something like 8 minutes with no flip required.",
				"Do you think this same recipe could be used for cauliflower?or  tempeh? One of our favorite places does tempeh wings and they&#8217;re so nice and crispy (obviously fried!) but we&#8217;d love to try a healthier version.",
				"This was amazing! I made a batch and then made more later in the week it was just so good. We ate it as a salad with blue cheese- which I have never liked before. It was very good with this. I just used the franks buffalo sauce as the sauce for the tofu and it was delicious and easy. I think the base recipe of the tofu sticks would be great with other sauces too- a lemon-y sauce to make a vegan lemon chicken.",
				"I don\u2019t know what I did wrong!! I was so excited to eat these and they ended up just tasting like cornstarch. I used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko, but don\u2019t think that should make too much of a difference. ???",
				"These exceeded my expectations. Buffalo wings are my number 1 craving, and these were fantastic. I served them in wraps with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and avocado. A creamy dressing would pair beautifully. As a vegan buffalo wing recipe 10/10 would recommend. Can&#8217;t wait to try the recipe with other sauces, too. Thank you!",
				"I am so impressed with this recipe! I made it using Frank&#8217;s new Buffalo Wings sauce. I forgot the 2 Tbsp. olive oil in the panko mixture but the tofu still turned out crispy and delicious. I did have to flip the wings about 15 minutes in to avoid browning them too much, but that could be a result of the lack of oil. They turned out very spicy and fantastic with light ranch dressing.\nThank you so much!",
				"These were soooo gooood &#8211; thank you!",
				"Just made this recipe and absolutely *loved* it. My husband isn&#8217;t keen on tofu, but I think I&#8217;ve got him hooked on this recipe. We absolutely adored the base tofu recipe without the sauce. The sauce nearly killed my hubby&#8217;s sensitive taste buds, so I had to tame it a bit. I will definitely be making this again though.",
				"I&#8217;ve been eyeing this recipe for a while now and am dying to make a salad w/ it, as pictured! Just curious what other veggies would go well w/ it? And if kale can be used instead of romaine?\nThanks so much!",
				"I made these tofu wings last night for dinner with some sweet potato chips a salad, and OMG they were so delicious. I used encona hot pepper sauce instead because thats what we had in the cupboard. I will definitely be making the again, everyone loved them!",
				"Thanks for sharing! Do they keep long?",
				"This looks so good! What a great protein meal prep to keep handy in the fridge!",
				"Thoughts on trying these in the air fryer?",
				"Stumbled on your site and this recipe today. I made the buffalo tofu wings tonight and loved them! Easy recipe with very good results! Thank you!",
				"Great taste better than I could imagine",
				"Can Sriracha be used instead of Frank&#8217;s Red Hot for a different flavor?",
				"We like this recipe so much that we are making the tofu into small cubes to have on skewers with sweet yellow peppers and cherry peppers for my daughter&#8217;s wedding reception.  We&#8217;ll have Follow Your Heart Bleu Cheese and JUST Ranch for the sauce options.",
				"We are a newly vegetarian couple and my boyfriends son is still a meat-eater. He had no idea this wasn\u2019t chicken or that the dressing (we used Daiya) was vegan!  We used regular butter instead of vegan butter bc it\u2019s what we had. But we LOVED this recipe!",
				"Omg these are soo damn good.!",
				"I was a bit disappointed with all the positive reviews.  It was decent but I feel the actual tofu needed some kind of  marinade for it to make me want to make it again.",
				"Can I use regular bread crumbs instead of the panko? Thanks.",
				"This turned out amazing! I didn\u2019t have \u201cfollow your heart\u201d ranch or blue cheese, but I do have vegannaise, mrs dash onion &amp; herb, and unsweetened soy milk on hand. That makes a great ranch dressing in a pinch. \ud83d\ude09",
				"I was in search of a baked tofu french fry recipe when I found this! Looks so good &#8211; I&#8217;m definitely going to try it! But how do you think this would be without the buffalo sauce, just as a good basic crunchy fry recipe?",
				"Just made these! So so good!!!",
				"What should I do to reheat it?",
				"Made these buffalo tofu wings for the family last night &#8211; they were soooo crispy and delicious. Everyone loved them dipped in Follow Your Heart Bleu Cheese style dressing.  Let&#8217;s just say there were no leftovers!  Yum Yum, Eva!",
				"Is it possible to skip on adding oil? ?",
				"Girrrrrllll! This recipe is incredible!  I\u2019m not a picky eater but rarely does a dish make me want to dance on the table. I didn\u2019t, but I wanted to. We had the wings on greens, topped sweet peppers, celery and cherry tomatoes. I thought I would never again get to eat buffalo style food but this has brought new hope. Now I have something to eat on \u201cgame day\u201d besides guacamole and chips. My roomies (who aren\u2019t vegan) loved it too and want me to make it again soon. Thank you so much! .",
				"These were AMAZING I&#8217;ve been looking for a recipe like this for years! They were perfect!!",
				"Amazing recipe! I made the 2x this week. Thanks for sharing and Happy New Year!",
				"Wow! These are amazing. I love them. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"I just finished this recipe. Amazingly good. I seriously had my doubts but.  WOW! So good. Thank you!\n     Matt J.   Denver, CO.",
				"I can&#8217;t read the directions because an ad is covering them up.  I tried reporting the ad to google but another one popped up immediately"

			],
			"time": "10 hours 15 minutes",
			"serving": "2 loaves",
			"recipe": [
				"1. In the bowl of a stand mixer or bread machine combine the all purpose and bread flours, sugar, salt, and instant yeast (see note below if using active dry yeast).",
				"2. Blend the silken tofu, plant milk, and vinegar together with a stick blender or upright blender until smooth. Add this to the dry ingredients and mix together with a wooden spoon until the dough is shaggy.",
				"3. Using the dough hook on the stand mixer knead the dough on low speed for 5 minutes to begin developing the dough. If using a bread machine, set it on the dough cycle and begin adding the vegan butter after 5 minutes of kneading.",
				"4. Slowly add the vegan butter while the mixer is on, just a couple tablespoons at a time. You may need to pause occasionally to scrape down the sides or push the soft butter into the dough manually. It can take up to 10 minutes to incorporate all of the butter.",
				"5. Once the butter has been kneaded in, let the mixer continue to knead for another 15-20 minutes to develop the dough. The silken tofu prevents you from being able to thinly stretch the dough into a window pane, but you will still see a smoother texture from the dough as it kneads.",
				"6. Turn the kneaded dough into a lightly oiled mixing bowl and turn the dough to coat in oil. Cover the bowl and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, at which point it will be puffy and increased about 50% in size.",
				"7. Place the dough in the fridge and refrigerate for at least 4 hours but ideally overnight or up to 1 day.",
				"8. Grease two standard loaf pans (8.5 x 4.5 inches) with vegan butter. You can also use 9\"x5\" loaf pans.",
				"9. Take the refrigerated dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces to make 2 loaves of bread. Shape each piece of dough into your desired shape (see post for more details).",
				"10. To make a braid: Divide the dough into three equal pieces and roll out until about 14 inches long. Arrange the ropes parallel to each other and starting about 1/3 of the way down from the top start braiding the dough. When you reach the end pinch the pieces together. Then braid the top part of the dough, you will have to braid in the opposite way to match the lower half. Pinch the top ends together, then tuck both ends under the bread. Gently transfer the braid into the greased pan.To make a segmented bread: Divide the dough into six equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in like a letter. Flatten the dough to a rectangle once again (about as wide as the loaf pan) then roll the dough from the short end to make a log. Place each segment into the loaf pan seam side down, squishing them flatter to fit.",
				"11. Cover the loaves with plastic wrap and let rise until about 1.5x as large, or the dough almost reaches the top of the pan. This will take 1-3 hours depending on ambient temperature.",

				"Hi &#8211; because I am lazy, I threw all the ingredients into the bread maker and my goodness! The result is amazing! I had to take half the dough out and cook it in the oven. But the next time I used 1/2 this recipe and just threw it all in the breadmaker and put it on the brioche setting and it comes out so nice. Thank you so much!",
				"My 8-year-old and I made this together this weekend, and it turned out great even though we didn\u2019t have bread flour on hand and subbed all purpose! She loved your braiding tutorial and is very proud of the loaf she braided all by herself.",
				"How many eggs and is it the whole egg or just yolk to use instead of tofu? And how much regular butter? Not wanting vegan. But this looks too easy not to make. Thank you.",
				"I don&#8217;t know how you managed to create this recipe, but it&#8217;s turned out perfect the two times that I&#8217;ve made it. I&#8217;m just so happy to be able to have brioche at home. Both times my breads were soft and fluffy, and the outside toasted just enough to form a sweet crust. I did make some tweaks. I used coconut oil instead of vegan butter, doubled the sugar and I put in a touch of turmeric as I&#8217;ve seen in other recipes, to Yellow the bread a little. Thank you so much for this recipe.  It&#8217;s easy, foolproof and makes simply delicious brioche!"

				"Yum. Before I found this site, I didn&#8217;t even like cake. From this site, I have made the vanilla cake, the carrot cake, the hazelnut cake, the easy chocolate cake, and now these cupcakes. I made all recipes exactly as written. This is my favorite. I went with my own recipe\nfor a cream cheese frosting. Red velvet is a great please everybody cake choice. This was used for a 5 year old&#8217;s birthday party. My second favorite so far is the vanilla, mostly because it&#8217;s the only vanilla cake I&#8217;ve ever actually wanted to eat. I recommend all of these recipes for non-vegan bakers also, because they are better than their stiff egg made counterparts. Just use some cake release and parchment rounds on the cakes or make cupcakes, and you&#8217;re just better off with these.",

				"I made these cinnamon buns, but I found them to be very sticky when rolling out, topping and rolling them up;  so I added a lot more flour.  I used pumpkin butter instead of apple, so I added some pumpkin spice to the cinnamon in the filling.  When I made the frosting, I encountered problems when I didn&#8217;t have time to shop for vegan cream cheese. I used another blogger&#8217;s recipe for vegan cream cheese frosting and it wasn&#8217;t as creamy as I&#8217;d have liked, I guess due to having no vegan butter included.

				"Thank you for this recipe! It tastes so similar to Upton\u2019s bacon mac ! I would suggest using 2 packages of Upton\u2019s bacon though. And I would suggest mixing the mac noodles and sauce in a separate pan, reserve some of the sauce. Cook the bacon til pretty crisp, then remove from the pan. In a nice cast iron pan, heat up a bit of oil, then add a few servings of mac and cheese, a thin layer. Let it toast, turn once, and then add plenty of the bacon right at the end so it\u2019s still crispy. At Upton\u2019s, their mac is more dry, so I that\u2019s why I\u2019ll reserve some of the sauce next time. A bit more dry to get that crisp on it. Maybe some toasted breadcrumbs to finish it? It was absolutely delish. So happy that you were able to capture the strong cheesy flavor in that sauce! Can\u2019t wait to re-crisp the leftovers tomorrow, maybe I\u2019ll grab some more bacon and add that too! Thanks again, very enjoyable, and saved me a trip to the city!"

				"I made this recipe with canned beans and a half of a chili pepper rather than a jalapeno (they&#8217;re difficult to find where I live).  I used a potato masher rather than an immersion blender to mash them up a bit &#8230; leaving some pieces inside.  Oh my goodness!  These are so very good!

I don&#8217;t have anything to compare it with, since I&#8217;ve never tried it anywhere, but this was delicious! Looking at other recipes, and from what I&#8217;ve probably seen on Indian restaurant buffets, Chana Masala looks soupy. I&#8217;m glad this one wasn&#8217;t, but I had to stir it frequently to keep it from sticking. I used dried garbanzos, soaked overnight and cooked, added a couple extra red chili peppers, and served it with brown basmati rice. I will be making this often, since I now have a lifetime supply of Indian spices. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
				"My family\u2019s Christmas Eve tradition is to gather with our Jewish friends for Indian food. So this year, I made Eva\u2019s chana masala, biryani, raita, and mango lassi for a feast at home. These are, by far, absolutely the most delicious Indian recipes I\u2019ve ever made &#8211; and I\u2019ve made recipes from many sources. I&#8217;ve finally found my go-to chana masala recipe now &#8211; no need for all the others I&#8217;ve tried over the years! Thank you, Eva &#8211; I will come back to your recipes again and again!",
				"definitely it is looking restaurant like chana masala. and I am sure it would taste like one. I always prefer to use tomato instead of amchur I hope this is ok. is it? thank you for sharing this blog.",
				"Great recipe. I used about 2 pounds of fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and 1 tbsp tamarind concentrate instead of mango powder. The sauce was slightly on the acidic side, so I added 1/2 tsp sugar to balance it out.",
				"Great recipe, must warn though that amchur is strong stuff indeed. I put in a heaped teaspoon and at first I thought \u201cmy goodness, tastes of cleaning powder\u201d. Next time maybe half a teaspoon for me. Perhaps more garum masala, a teaspoon or even two. A little more methi maybe.\nIt\u2019s all taste though of course and this is an awesome recipe, thanks again \ud83d\ude42",
				"Wow&#8230; amazing description and details&#8230;",
				"If I want to make a smaller batch (for 2 people) should I reduce the amount of spices accordingly? I.e if making half the batch, should I use half the amount of spices? Thank you! So excited to make this!!",
				"I made this recipe, trying to stick to the recipe as close as I could, and it turned out fantastic. Thanks for sharing this one!",
				"Lacking pomi, I ran a can of diced tomatoes through a blender with 2 tbsp plain tomato paste with good results.  Next time I&#8217;ll leave out the cayenne and add a minced jalapeno.  Dutch oven on the stove top at moderate temperature, it came out great.  Thank you.",
				"Wow!  This was amazing.  I used 3 peppers and it was the perfect heat.  I served this dish with curried fried rice&#8230;. just delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!!",
				"This is a delicious and flavorful recipe. But don\u2019t add the full amount of spices unless you want a burning hot dish. I had to add more chickpeas, two more cans of diced tomatoes, and coconut milk to dilute it enough to eat. But it is a great recipe and very simple to prepare. Just adjust the seasons to the level of spiciness you prefer.",
				"A bit too much tomato for my taste, otherwise very nice",
				"I bought a garam masala spice mix. Im wondering how much i should use as it has all the spices blended together. Thanks",
				"Do you skin your chickpeas before adding them to the masala? Also would crushed red pepper flakes work as a sub for the dried red hot chilies? Thank you!",
				"I prefer to cook my chickpeas rather than use a can. Have you ever done that? Looking at the recipe it looks like I would only need to leave out the salt until the end. Thoughts?",
				"This dish is soooo great! We serve it with long grain brown rice and its just the perfect mix and so hearty. I have tried your lentil bolognese too and its so good! Love, love, love your recipes. I can&#8217;t wait to try more!! Thanks for making it easy and delicious to eat vegan : )",
				"WHAT can I sub for the carton of strained tomatoes? An equally size can of diced tomatoes or crushed ones?",
				"If I don&#8217;t have cardamom pods, can I substitute ground cardamom, and if so, how much?",
				"Husband has a mango allergy. How about substituting Anardana powder instead?",
				"Followed exactly. This is the best C.M. recipe I\u2019ve ever made. It will be my new go-to. Thanks!!",
				"Oops, forgot to rate this tasty dish!",
				"Whoa, this recipe is SO delicious! I made it tonight and my whole family loved it!!!  The flavours were out of this world!  Thanks for another amazing recipe, Eva!!!"

I was skeptical that the tempeh would stick together, but it went together just like your photos. We are putting on the grill. The slaw is really worth it and I made the gochuchang mayo for the bun. All that&#8217;s left is the grill meister&#8217;s deft touch and we&#8217;ll be in Gochuchang heaven soon,\nthanks for a great recipe,\nSusan"

			"title": "Easy Homemade Vegan Gnocchi Recipe",
			"ingredients": [
				"1 lb 4 oz (535g) baked and peeled russet potatoes (~4 1/2 cups riced, unpacked)",
				"1 tsp (5g) salt",
				"2 tbsp (20g) olive oil",
				"2 1/2 cups (284g) all purpose flour, more as needed"
			],
			"time": "40 minutes",
			"serving": "2 lbs cooked gnocchi",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Take the peeled, cooked and cooled potatoes and cut them into sections. Using one section at a time, press them through a potato ricer. Alternatively, mash them well so that no lumps remain.",
				"2. In a large bowl add the riced or mashed potato, salt, olive oil, and flour and using clean hands mix the ingredients together and then squeeze to gently knead it into a cohesive ball. If the mixture is sticky add flour until it no longer sticks to your hand. If you can't get the flour to fully absorb and mix into the potatoes add a little extra olive oil until it comes together. The key is to not have a wet and sticky dough so that it's easy to work with and form into little dumplings.",
				"3. Keeping the dough covered so it doesn't dry out, take a small section at a time to form into the gnocchi. Take a 1 tsp (~6g) piece of dough and squeeze it in your fist to make a compact and roughly shaped ball, then roll it between your palms to make it round.",
				"4. For the traditional gnocchi shape with the grooves on one side, place a fork sitting face down on the counter and take the ball and place it at the top of the backside of the tines of the fork. With your thumb on the piece of dough, slide the gnocchi down the tines of the fork until you reach the counter. The gnocchi will turn under your thumb until it has grooves going around about 3/4 of the dough and a small inset divot where your thumb was.",
				"5. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. If the dough becomes sticky at any point, toss shaped gnocchi with flour so they don't stick together and knead a bit of extra flour into the remaining unshaped dough.",
				"6. To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add half the gnocchi to the pot and let it cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the top and have cooked an additional minute at the top. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon and then cook the second batch of gnocchi.",
				"7. Use the cooked gnocchi in your favorite recipe, or store in the fridge for up to a week (you can freeze for longer)."

				"Always thought gnocchi above my skill level.  After reading this recipe and watching the video decided to give a try.  The step by step detailed instructions made it a breeze.  Came out perfect the very 1st attempt!   Baked Gnocchi with Arrabbiata and Vegan Mozzarella on the menu tonight.",
				"Hi! Do you think I can use instant mashed potatoes and it will work?",
				"I made I small batch of these delicious \ud83d\ude0b gnocchi for the #danielfast and they were great so I stayed up until about 3:00am making more for my family for dinner Tomorrow. Since there are six of us I was rolling and cutting dough for quite a while but it is worth it! I love this and I wish I could add pictures because they came out great!",
				"Okay. I love this recipe. I&#8217;m so happy to have found a vegan recipe for gnocchi! I followed the instructions (though didn&#8217;t weigh my potatoes :/ ) and got a pretty good result. However, the dough had a hard time staying together, even when I added a ton more olive oil. After perusing the comments a bit I see others had the same problem when using gluten-free flour, which I did. The remedy seems to be adding a couple flax &#8220;eggs&#8221; to bind the dough. I will definitely try that next time I make this, cuz I definitely want to try again!\nOh also, even though I struggled to get the gnocchi to stay in shape, they held together just fine when cooking. The end result was super sticky because of all the oil I used, so I laid them out to dry a bit on a sheet of parchment paper so that they didn&#8217;t all glob together.",
				"This was pretty good.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the flavor of olive oil with some foods.  This is one of them.  The next time I do this recipe (cuz I will) I&#8217;ll use grapeseed oil or something like that. I&#8217;m also thinking of plant based butter with this.  I paired this with a vegan mushroom sauce. I&#8217;ll def try it again!!",
				"Could I use oat flour instead?\nThank you",
				"I&#8217;ve had trouble making vegan gnocchi in the past, it has been very hard to roll out and hasn&#8217;t bound properly. I love this recipe! I peeled then boiled my potatoes because I find it easier that way, and I had excellent results \ud83d\ude42",
				"Thank you for posting this recipe. It was super easy and informative. I made it yesterday and my gnocchi came out great. ?\u2764",
				"Please, what is contained in All Purpose Flour. My husband is allergic to wheat, and I have just bought my first bag of Gram Flour.\nTIA. Jjanette",
				"I did 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular potato. I forgot that I was low on AP flour so I had to use mostly whole wheat flour. I put in way more than 2.5 cups flour and it was STILL sticky. I ran out of whole wheat flour too, and it was still way too sticky to shape, so I had to throw it out unfortunately.",
				"it says above the recipe\n You can reheat cooked gnocchi either in the sauce it\u2019s being served in, or by blanching briefly in boiling water. You can also toast it on the stove in a bit of olive oil\nHope this helps",
				"I made these gnocchi and they were absolutely delicious. I am so pleased with this recipe and the result. I tried to make gnocchi once before and it was a disaster, so am really chuffed with the result tonight. I also crisped them in olive oil and added them to saut\u00e9ed garlic, spinach, red sweet pepper and chilli with some vegan rashers thrown in. Vegan Parmesan sprinkled on top. Oh so yummy ?",
				"I tried this and really worked!\nMy little one has gluten  allergy and I could never make fresh pasta.\nThis was so delicious and she loved it.\nThank you",
				"Just use gluten free flour",
				"Tried this recipe. Way too much flour in my opinion. I would recommend starting with 1cup.",
				"It is a great recipe! So easy ( a bit long, but hey, I&#8217;m not complaining) simple and fun to make! I really enjoyed making gnocchi for the first time. I roasted the potatoes on my microwave and they had the perfect texture ( although I killed the microwave in the process of cooking the last potato&#8230;) But seriously, it is really good thank you for the recipe. \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi. Do you think this would work with Yukon gold potatoes? Thanks.",
				"This recipe was perfect. I don&#8217;t have anything else to say, thanks for the help \ud83d\ude42",
				"I made them yesterday and they were delicious! But I definitely disagree here. The ammount I got was for serving 4 people very well, or 5 or 6 people with a decent size plate without repeating. I served it with tomato sauce and veggies",
				"Planning to make gnocchi tomorrow. Can\u2019t wait.. recipe looks easy enough and you have walked Us through the possible pitfalls.",
				"Hi there! I\u2019m hoping to make this for dinner tonight, how many people does this recipe serve? Thanks!",
				"Can I freeze the gnocchi?",
				"Thank you so much Daniel. I JUST got your reply today, 2/3/2020 and that is the only reason you did not hear from me sooner. God Bless you for the info &lt;3",
				"Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I served this in a pesto soup and people loved it!",
				"I just made them with Pamela&#8217;s all-porpoise GF flour. The dough broke apart so I added a couple &#8220;vegan eggs&#8221; for a binder and that helped hold the dough together. To make a vegan egg just combine  2 tbsp flax seed and 6 tbsp warm water and let sit for 5 minutes. Dump that into the dough and it will help bind.",
				"How would you reheat these once cooked and cooled? Microwave or hot water?",
				"Need a gluten-free vegan version please&#8230;..love gnocchi and hated giving them up",
				"OMG I have just found this as I am moving towards a vegan lifestyle and they are amazing and |I love your passion for Gnocchi, it mirrors my own.  I will bookmark you, but I will make this recipe soon x",
				"I understand your obsession with gnocchi, they are just so delicious and soft. This looks very good!"

				"Nice recipe but i wanted to mention that your &#8220;classic&#8221; wonton shape, while perfectly functional, is not the real wonton shape. For real chinese wontons you place teaspoon of filling just above one corner of wrapper, fold corner over filling, roll to tuck point under. Moisten two side corners and pull them together behind filled corner and overlap slightly, pinch together to seal. This leaves a nice floaty little tail. Takes a little practice but just as easy once you get the hang of it. Of course you can also just pinch corner to corner for a triangle shape before sticking ends together or stick with the rectangle shape like youve done. In the end the only things that really matter are that they taste delicious and are cruelty free!",
				"So amazing! We had some leftover wonton wrappers and needed to use them up, and since then they&#8217;ve been a staple. We added maybe 5x the amount of scallions because we&#8217;re fiends for the stuff. We pan fried then steamed for the crunch and chew and OMG.",
				"Delicious!!  I haven\u2019t had wonton soup in years and now I\u2019m so happy to have a vegan recipe for the wontons I remember from chinese restaurants before I went vegan!  I froze the rest of the batch and plan to test a few in the air fryer later this week- I will update with the results.  Thank you Eva!",

I have three 8-inch cake pans so that I can make a three-layer cake, does that mean that I have to triple the amount on the &#8220;1 8-inch cake&#8221; recipe? And therefore use 600 grams of flour for example, is that correct? \nJust wondering because I really want this cake to turn out good! Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude42",

				"Hi!\nI just made this but haven\u2019t tasted it yet. The batter was REALLY thick and the resulting baked layers seem a little dry. I have to of course still taste it but is the batter supposed to be sooo thick?? I had to spread it in the pan with an offset knife",
				"This cake was just the perfect texture and turned out beautifully.  My most successful attempt at making a vegan layer cake.  In the past, the cake had always turned out very dense &#8211; but the use of baking soda/powder with vinegar really did the trick &#8211; even with heavy ingredients like walnuts and carrots.  \nI thought my cream cheese frosting was going to be an epic fail.  I used &#8220;Better than Cream Cheese&#8221; by Tofutti and when I tried to whip it with the vegan butter, the cream cheese began to separate. I had milking water along with blobs of fat. Perhaps the cream cheese should have sat out longer to get to room temperature. But I trusted the process, and as I added the first cup of the powdered sugar, the cornstarch in the sugar fixed everything and it all came together beautifully.\nI used almond paste instead of marzipan for the carrots (because that&#8217;s what I had on hand) and it worked just fine.  Using parsley for the carrot tops is an inspiration. \nI can&#8217;t thank you enough for the recipe and all the decorating tips and tricks.",

Not sure if that\u2019s because the recipe was meant to call for kosher salt and I was using registrable salt. I will definitely make this again!",
				"The taste of this cake was incredible however my sponge came out ever so slightly too dry and I wonder why that could be? Or if there are any slight changes I could make? I used a fan assisted oven but otherwise everything was exactly the same. I checked it about 5 minutes before I took it out and the skewer came out with a little batter on it, then after the further 5 minutes the skewer came out clean but as I said, slightly too dry. Any suggestions?\nThanks soooo much for this recipe!",

				"Which measurements should i follow if i was doing 3 6 inch pans?",
				"Thanks for replying. I made it before you replied. I did the single 8 inch divided into 2 pans and it was actually perfect. Cooked for 20 mins though. Probably the most delicious carrot cake I have ever eaten",
				"Totally confused by the number of tins/slices this recipe makes.\nDoes the amount for an 8 inch cake = divided into 2 sandwich tins? Or for 2 sandwich tins do I need to do the receipt quantity for \u201c2 cakes\u201d?",
				"Just wanted to say this vegan carrot cake recipe Is FANTASTIC! It\u2019s even better than some non-vegan ones that I have tried in the past. \nI made it into a loaf using the 2 x 8 inch recipe and baked it for about 80 minutes and it was so good we devoured half of it when it came out of the oven! Thanks for this recipe, it will be my go-to!",

				"This carrot cake recipe is SO good!! I just made it tonight and it turned out absolutely perfect, actually even better than regular, dairy-filled carrot cakes or store bought carrot cakes. My family loved it and they couldn\u2019t believe it was vegan.\nThe only adjustment I made was that I added less sugar than called for in the vegan cream cheese frosting (5 cups) and it was still too sweet for me, but I\u2019m very sensitive to sweets and just have to adjust to my liking.\nThank you so much for sharing!"

				"The best part of this recipe is the no-boil one pot piece. I&#8217;d love to make this without the vegan cheese. I did check out the other recipes, but all involve lots more work and cleanup. Is there way to use this method without the vegan cheese?",
				"This has been my go-to since I heard about  the NON-vegan version on some TV talk show! It looked like such a great idea I figured there HAD to be a vegan version. And with a quick search, I discovered there was!!!\nI would post a photo, but so far it\u2019s been late in the evening (bad light) and my family inhales this as soon as I get it out of the oven!!  Just know it\u2019s a HUGE hit."

Decades and many moves around the country later, I&#8217;ve never been able to find a &#8220;subji&#8221; dish or recipe.

I was googling a recipe for aloo matar after getting a mad indian food craving while only having pantry staples and was so excited to find this recipe from YOU!

				"1 bunch scallions, dark and light green parts thinly sliced",
				"Oil, to cook"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 35 minutes",
			"serving": "6 pancakes",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Mix the flour and salt together for the dough, pour in the boiling hot water and mix together with chopsticks or a wooden spoon to make a dough. Then, knead the dough using a stand mixer (if kneading by hand let cool enough to handle without burning yourself) for 5-8 minutes to make a supple and slightly tacky dough.",
				"2. Oil a mixing bowl and place the dough ball in the bowl, turning to coat the dough with oil. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but ideally 1-2 hours. Alternatively, wrap dough in plastic and place in fridge to rest overnight.",
				"3. When ready to shape the pancakes, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using in a small dish. Carefully add the hot oil and stir together.",
				"4. Lightly oil a silicon mat or a clean countertop and turn out the dough. Divide into 6 pieces, and place them back in their covered bowl or under a damp towel.",
				"5. Take out one piece of dough at a time and roll until the dough is thin into large rectangle shape. Brush the dough with the flour-oil mixture and sprinkle with sliced scallions.",
				"6. Roll the long edge of the dough over the scallions to make a rope, then roll the rope starting at one end to make a spiral shape. Tuck the second end of the rope under the spiral to hold it in place.",
				"7. Flatten the spiral with your hand to make a disk, then roll out until the pancake is about 6-7\" in diameter. Place the rolled pancake on parchment paper and top with a second piece of parchment paper. Repeat the shaping with the remaining pieces of dough. You can stack the shaped pancakes, sandwiching them between parchment paper.",
				"8. To cook the pancakes: heat a skillet (two to make it go faster) or griddle over medium heat. Add a layer of oil and once hot fry the pancakes. Cook the pancakes 3-5 minutes on each side, flipping as needed to keep them from burning (turn down the heat if cooking too fast). Add more oil or use a silicon brush to push the oil back into the center as needed.",
				"9. Place the cooked pancakes on a paper towel lined plate or cooling rack and let rest for a few minutes before eating!"

I try to keep my meals lower-sodium so I used lower-sodium crushed tomatoes, and home-made no-salt beans.\nI&#8217;ve eaten this chili so far once topped with sauerkraut, and once topped with tofutti.

It surprised me how good it tastes!. Managed to get 9-500 ml jars from this recipe, so there&#8217;s a goodly number of frozen meals for me. I&#8217;m trying to eat no to very low oil, so only using 1 tbsp of oil to cook the onions and garlic was fine with me. \nOverall I&#8217;d give this two spoons up!! DELICIOUS!",

				"Thank you for this recipe! Just wondering why the batter turned out too thin and dripped off the cauliflowers while in the oven. Is it really supposed to be 1.5 cups of milk or just 0.5? Also there was a lot of batter left so I suspect I need to make it much thicker next time. The sauce is a great idea! Very tasty, but my brands of ketchup and cranberry must have had way more sugar than yours, the sauce was sticky sweet and lots left over. I&#8217;ll halve it next time and use it very sparingly. Thanks again!!"

				"7. Fry the donuts in the oil until they are a dark golden, about 2 1/2 - 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. You can check for doneness by inserting a probe thermometer into the donuts and they should read at or over 185 \u00baF.",
				"8. Transfer the donuts to a paper towel lined plate to drain.",
				"9. If coating with cinnamon sugar: whisk together the sugar and spices in a bowl, and dip the donuts in while they are still warm.If coating in maple glaze: Whisk together the glaze ingredients in a bowl starting with no added milk. Add the plant milk in increments of 1 or 2 teaspoons until you have a thick and spreadable glaze. Dip one side of the donuts into the glaze once the donuts have cooled. Set on a plate or tray to catch any drips and let the glaze dry to the touch."

				"Hello! Do you think that I could rest these in the fridge overnight to fry for breakfast? Would I have to adjust the baking powder? Thank you!",
				"Hi Eva!\nI made these fab donuts for our friend\u2019s gathering over the weekend. I followed your recipe precisely, and these turned out amazing \u2013 crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, as you mention. My sons ate those all up! These donuts have all chances to become a true family favorite.\nThank you so much for sharing the idea with us and all of your precious recommendations. They helped me avoid mistakes. Look forward to your new awesome recipes. I\u2019m a real fan of what you do. You are an inspiration for us all. Keep it up!\nLove,\nAnn"

			"title": "Vegan Cabbage, Potato, and Chickpea Sheet Pan Dinner",
			"ingredients": [
				"1 small head cabbage (~1 1/2 - 2 lbs)",
				"1 lb potatoes, fingerling, red, or yukon gold",
				"2 cups cooked chickpeas (15oz can), drained and rinsed",
				"1/4 cup olive oil",
				"2 tbsp red wine vinegar",
				"2 tbsp dijon mustard",
				"2-4 cloves garlic, minced",
				"1/2 tsp smoked paprika",
				"1/2 tsp dried oregano",
				"1/2 tsp salt",

				"1 cup cashews",
				"2 1/2 cups vegetable broth",
				"2 tbsp flour (gluten free or all purpose)",
				"2 tbsp vegan butter or olive oil",
				"1/2 tsp salt, or to taste",
				"black pepper to taste",
				"1 1/2 tbsp fresh tarragon, chopped",
				"1 tsp fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried)"
			],
			"time": "1 hour",
			"serving": "6 servings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF.",
				"2. Cut your cabbage into 1/2\" thick slices, then cut into wedges and remove the core. Cut your potatoes into half or quarters if using fingerling, or cubed to about 1/2 to 3/4-inch pieces if red skinned or yukon gold. No need to peel. Arrange cabbage, potatoes, and chickpeas on a half sheet pan.",
				"3. In a bowl or liquid measuring cup whisk together all of the mustard vinaigrette ingredients. Pour over the sheet pan and toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer on the sheet pan. Bake for 35-50 minutes, stirring after 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the cabbage is tender and starting to crisp around the edges.",
				"4. Make the gravy: if not using a high powered blender, boil the cashews in water for 10-15 minutes to soften. Drain before using. If using a powerful blender skip this step. Blend the cashews and vegetable broth together until creamy and smooth.",
				"5. In a pot heat the vegan butter or olive oil over medium low and add the flour. Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until the flour is a bit toasty smelling and a shade darker (if using a starch or gluten free blend it may not change color). Slowly pour in the cashew cream while whisking to make a smooth gravy.",
				"6. Turn the heat up to medium and bring to a simmer. Add the salt, pepper, tarragon, and thyme. Simmer until the gravy has thickened. Cover and set aside.",
				"7. Serve the sheet pan dinner hot from the oven over your choice of grain or bread. Drizzle over the gravy and garnish with fresh herbs. Enjoy!"

				"This is my all time favorite recipe. I make it on a weekly basis and I never get sick of it. It\u2019s soooo amazingly delicious. I never have tarragon so I make a sage thyme gravy and it\u2019s wonderful. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!! \ud83e\udd70",
				"I found this recipe last night. I wanted to finish what I had left of my cabbage and OH MY GOODNESS! The creamy Tarragon gravy!! I was so proud of myself for how perfect it came out. Even the vinaigrette dressing mixed in with all those wonderful veggies, WOW!!! This entire recipe&#8230;CHEF&#8217;S KISS!!! Please give it a try in making it, you will not be disappointed!",
				"Just wanted to say thank you for sharing! Made this for the family tonight. They loved it. I substituted the potato for sweet potatoes and made quinoa. Was lovely.",
				"So just made this, no cabagge. Subbed in carrots and red bell peppers.\nThe gravy was delish, and the chickpeas crunchy!!\nI was afraid it would not be good, cuz it felt like a lot of work, but I was not disappointed!! Hubby said, good job dear!\nI think this will be made again!!",
				"Could I use a can of coconut milk instead of the cashews?",
				"Can&#8217;t wait to try this but I don&#8217;t have any tarragon, what other herb would work here?",
				"Insanity!!!! One of the best things I have ever eaten!!!! The gravy is so good I want to drink it. Thank you!!",
				"This is delicious and easy!!! My husband wanted to lick his plate clean! I will make again often.\nWe do have a vitamix, but still soaked cashews in boiled water while prepping veggies.",
				"We have a nut allergy so can\u2019t use cashews. Any alternatives?",
				"Was looking for a good vegan main dish that used cabbage, and this one really fit the bill.  Terrific combination of easy to make and very tasty.  Really liked the layering of flavors with the mustard vinaigrette and the delicious cashew based gravy.  Our daughter is vegan so always looking for new recipes to keep our menu interesting.\nThanks very much, will definitely make again!",
				"I&#8217;ve made this dish tonight and WOW! Simple to make but nevertheless delicious. Thanks for sharing. \ud83d\ude42",
				"Out of the oven I though the Dijon would be too much for them AND I had to use cornstarch and sage instead of cashews and tarragon for the gravy, but my kids (and I) loved this with biscuits. The gravy made a lot, so I&#8217;ll freeze it for next time. This is really a tasty and easy recipe that is, as we say, restaurant quality \ud83d\ude42 Thank you!",
				"This is the best dish I\u2019ve ever cooked and I\u2019m not even vegan. I cooked this for myself and my vegan fiancee and this dish absolutely blew me away. I didn\u2019t have tarragon so I used basil and the gravy still came out great.",
				"Hi there&#8230; I don&#8217;t have cashews, but have either pecans or almonds.  Would either of these be an adequate substitute?",
				"Love this, everything was so tasty, especially the gravy!",
				"I agree with Sarah, love the gravy it would make a great sauce for anything!",
				"I found this while trying to find recipes to use up the vegetables I got in my CSA. It was delicious. Didn&#8217;t have tarragon, so I made a thyme and mushroom cream gravy. My meat-eater husband woofed it down! A big hit! So delicious!",
				"Although this looks like a good winter dish (it&#8217;s hot here), we had local potatoes and cabbage and decided to make it. We ended up grilling the cabbage/potatoes/chickpeas to keep our kitchen cooler and it came out beautifully. My wife was practically drinking the gravy and the smell of the mustard was divine. Thanks so much.",
				"Absolutely delicious! Everything balanced perfectly and this was my first attempt at any kind of cashew cream based anything (I am new to the plant based life style, but I am loving it)! Thank you for the recipe!",
				"Good recipe!  The gravy was delicious &#8211; I debated about making it, but I think it was my favorite part and would be yummy on just about anything (oooo&#8230;maybe even as a pizza sauce with prosciutto and arugula on top!).",
				"Thank you Eva for providing this recipe!  You have helped me develop a deeper appreciation for the humble head of cabbage, thanks to the marinade recipe. I just bought my second head of cabbage within two weeks for this recipe\u2026 that\u2019s never happened before! Hope you and your loved ones are staying well during these COVID times.",
				"Tried this as an impromptu part of Easter dinner.  We didn\u2019t have chickpeas (ran out in my Coronavirus pantry), but it was still great.  We had it over couscous.  The whole family loved it &#8211; especially the gravy &#8211; and couldn\u2019t stop raving.  Thanks so much!",
				"Shelter-in-Recipe! Just whipped this up for lunch with tortilla chips. Subbed red onion slices for the potatoes and subbed BBQ sauce for the gravy, may do tahini on top next time with pita for a more middle eastern version.\nEveryone loved it! Thank you for sharing! \ud83d\ude42",
				"I\u2019ve just fallen in love with this easy and nutritious vegan sheet pan dinner. The potatoes indeed look so beautifully tender and the cabbage is so soft and crispy. Plus, the tarragon gravy is such a great accompaniment. Perfect dinner for those days when you don\u2019t wanna spend time cooking. I\u2019d like to know how it\u2019d taste when served with brown rice or quinoa.\nEva, thank you so much for sharing this idea. Such treasure. Really in the mood for something like this. Lucky me, I have all the ingredients at home. All of your tips will surely help me a lot. I\u2019m so happy to have stumbled across your awesome blog. Look forward to your new recipes.",
				"I used my veggies on hand, and roasted them with your vinaigrette. Very delish!\nI made wild rice blend, a pot of pinto beans, salad, and homemade vegan ranch. Super Yum",
				"I found this recipe on Pinterest last night. It is delicious beyond measure and we made a few mistakes. I bought Cashews that were roasted and salty and I didn&#8217;t use rice or anything to go with it. My husband and I wolfed it down and now I am looking for more recipes by her."

I saut\u00e9ing 8 oz of pressed extra-firm tofu cubes in oil with half a yellow onion sliced lengthwise. (No scallions at home) added extra cloves of garlic too &#8212; almost too much but still good. With the tofu and broccoli, served over rice, I will double the sauce next time.

On a dinner plate combine the panko with the vegan parmesan. Keep a separate wet fork and dry fork to make breading less messy.",

Knead by hand or using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer for about 5 minutes, or until the seitan dough has been developed and is very elastic and you see long strands of gluten development (it will look a bit stringy). It will be very stretchy when done.",

Add the wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, salt, and herbs to the food processor and process for about 2-3 minutes or until the seitan is well kneaded and you see strands of gluten development and the dough looks stringy. It will be very stretchy when done. Pause your food processor every 30 seconds or so to check the seitan dough and give the motor a break.",
				"5. Divide the dough into 12 equal sized pieces. Prepare 12 sheets of aluminum foil, about 6\" x 10\". Form each piece of seitan dough into a cutlet, about 1/2\" thick. Place the cutlet in the center of a piece of foil and wrap the foil to overlap in the center. Fold the ends, rolling towards the cutlet, stopping once you reach it. You will have a small and tightly wrapped package. Repeat with remaining cutlets.",
				"6. Set up a steamer pot on the stove, or a steamer insert into a pressure cooker. If steaming stovetop: Place the cutlets in the steamer basket and let steam for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool down. Once cool enough to handle remove from the basket and use or store for later. If steaming in the pressure cooker:  Stack cutlets on steamer basket, make sure they remain below the max fill line. Set to cook on high pressure for 15 minutes, then allow the pressure to release naturally for at least 20 minutes. Then you can vent and let cool enough to handle before removing the seitan and using immedaitely or storing for later."

				"Can&#8217;t wait to try this! Can I prepare it ahead of time and just toss in the oven at dinner time?",

				"Can you freeze this dish",
				"Would it be ok to use almonds instead of cashews?",
				"This is a recipe I know I&#8217;ll make forever! I made it for Thanksgiving with a few adjustments, I only used zucchini and I doubled the recipe to feed more people. Although it still came out fantastic, I think next time I&#8217;ll use two baking dishes instead of putting 2 layers on one so it comes out more evenly cooked. I&#8217;m excited to try it with potatoes as the original recipe says. The cashew sauce is truly unmatched. Thanks so much.",
				"Can you sub dry tarragon?",
				"Hi!\nThank you very much for this delicious recipe. I made it last night for dinner for my husband and I.\nI made a couple of changes for a healthier recipe, so I omitted the nutricional yeast and the vegan mozzarella .\n I added more water to the cashew &#8220;milk&#8221; and added  a little evoo as well.  It was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!\nI had to cook it for quite a bit longer&#8230;we probably have different potatoes here in South America and it was SO worth the wait.\nAgain&#8230;thank you for sharing your recipe with us all&#8230;you rock!!!"

				"2 tbsp tahini",
				"2 tsp sriracha or chili oil (to taste)",
				"1 tsp doubanjiang or miso",
				"1 tsp toasted sesame oil",
				"1/4 tsp black pepper"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 30 minutes",
			"serving": "12 buns",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water in a large liquid measuring cup or mixing bowl. Stir and let sit for a few minutes to get foamy. Add the oil.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix together with a wooden spoon or by hand (wetting your hand to prevent sticking), until you have a coarse dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and knead by hand around 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add flour if necessary, though give it a minute before adding as it takes time for the flour to absorb the moisture. You should have a soft and lightly tacky dough (not sticky). Alternatively you can knead in a stand mixer on low speed for 4-5 minutes.",
				"3. Transfer the dough ball to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 45 minutes - 1 hour until doubled in size.",
				"4. Trim the ends of the eggplant and cut them in half. Brush with oil, then grill over medium-high heat (using grill pan or outdoor grill) until the eggplant is tender when pierced with a fork, about 4-5 minutes each side, but this depends on size of eggplant. When cool enough to handle, cut grilled eggplant into ~3/4\" cubes",
				"5. Heat the oil and garlic in a small pot over low heat. When the garlic turns a pale golden--not too dark or it will taste burnt--carefully add the liquids and whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and let simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce is thickened.",
				"6. Toss the eggplant in the sauce.",
				"7. Punch down the dough and divide into 12 (~54 g) balls of dough. Let rest a few minutes before shaping so the gluten has a chance to relax.",
				"8. Prepare your steaming apparatus and bring water to a boil. Line the steamer with parchment to prevent sticking and/or cut 12 ~2.5\" squares of parchment paper to use with each bun.",
				"9. Pat or roll out each piece of dough into a ~5\" round. Place in your non-dominant hand, and a heaping tablespoon of the eggplant to the center. Take opposing sides of the dough and pinch together over the filling with your thumb and forefinger. Repeat pinching the dough together as you go around the bun until all of the dough meets in the center. Pinch and twist the top to seal it off. Place the bun on a piece of parchment paper and repeat with the remaining dough.",
				"10. When the water is boiling place the buns in batches in the steamer basket. Be careful not to overcrowd as they double in size while steaming. In my steamer I can make 4 at a time. Keep the remaining shaped buns in the refrigerator while you steam so that they do not get over proofed.",
				"11. Steam each batch 12-15 minutes. Best enjoyed warm or on the same day. Store leftovers in a tightly sealed container in the fridge and reheat in the microwave until warm. Cover with a damp paper towel while microwaving if they feel dry."

			"recipe": [
				"1. Measure out the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add in the salt and stir to dissolve. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let sit for a couple of minutes to hydrate and dissolve, then stir to distribute.",
				"2. Add the flour into the mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until you form a shaggy dough. Switch to using your hands. Wet your hands to prevent the dough from sticking to them and pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then reach under the edges of the dough and gently pull it up to stretch the dough until you hit resistance, then fold the section of dough over to rest of the dough. Turn the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat the pulling and folding until you've gone all around. This action brings the dough back into one piece. Repeat the pinching and folding process for about 1-2 minutes until your dough starts to turn into a cohesive, but sticky ball of dough. Re-wet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking to them. Cover the bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.",
				"3. After the 20 minutes of rest, turn the dough onto a clean and floured surface. Knead the dough for about 1 minute until you get a smooth ball of dough. Flour your hands and add flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil and place the ball of dough mixing bowl, turning to coat in oil before leaving seam side down. Cover the mixing bowl and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, until it's doubled in size. You can let it rise for up to 2 hours before shaping.",
				"4. Turn the dough onto a clean, floured counter and stretch to make a large rectangle. You're going to divide the dough into 2 or 3 pieces (depending on the size you want your final pizza to be) by sprinkling flour over where you're going to cut (this prevents it from sticking) and cut into the sections with a bench scraper, or with a butter knife by pressing straight down into the dough.",
				"5. Shape the dough one piece at a time. To shape the dough, you will use the same folding technique as before (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball. Then, turn the ball of dough and place seam side down on a clean, un-floured section of the counter. Cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Repeat with the remaining sections of dough, then place on a floured plate. Sprinkle more flour on top of the dough, then cover with plastic wrap and place the plate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, or up to 72 hours, before making pizza.",
				"6. Before shaping the dough and baking, let come to room temperature and relax for about 1 hour. If you try to shape the dough and it's not stretching out easily or quickly, let it rest for 10 minutes then try again."

				"@Taylor Dent, \nCooking pizza with cast iron is epic. When using cast iron you usually want to use a dutch oven, that is have a lid that can absorb heat as well.\nmy suggestion is to heat the cast iron first and with a peel drop the pizza into the pan so you can use the heat of the pan to do the cooking, and, make it well covered with a lid of some sort, any pan / lid is better than foil and it should work well.",

				"I just attempted this recipe. When I go to reach my hands into the bowl after first mixing with a wooden spoon, my hands get covered in dough &#8211; despite wetting them thoroughly first. I weighed out the flour according to your recipe and double checked the water amount but it seems insanely wet. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to be able to knead this without adding a bunch more flour in. What am I doing wrong?",
				"This recipe was perfect! Thank you for explaining the importance of extra hydration for pizza going into a home oven as opposed to a high heat pizza or commercial oven. Also thanks for the tips on the pizza peel. I do. It have a peel but I applied the same principles to a flat baking sheet and it worked wonderfully. We divided the pizza dough in 2, made one large pizza for the 2 of us and froze the second for another time, and I can\u2019t wait! Literally so excited over this recipe",
				"Hello, \nI just wanted to know if I could do the kneading using a stand mixer? \nThank you!!",
				"@Eva Agha, yay! Thanks so much for responding so quickly!",
				"Hi I hope you see this tonight and are able to comment back. I was planning on using this recipe and just skimmed through for the ingredients at the store. Then I started reading everything when I got home and saw where it said this is a wetter dough because it\u2019s made for an oven and longer cooking time. I am making this for my dad\u2019s house tomorrow and he has an outdoor brick oven. So this will only be cooked about 1-3 minutes at around 800 degrees. Will this still work!? Thank you!",
				"I understand this is an old post and you may not see this but I\u2019m gonna ask anyway\u2026 Do you have a video or pictures steps to describe the pinching and pulling that seem to be a required step? I can\u2019t seem to figure out what you mean! Or perhaps you know of another similar recipe that already has a video?",
				"I know sugar is not needed but I tend to like a touch of sweetness. Can I add a pinch of sugar or will it throw off the rising process? And if it&#8217;s ok to add, when and how much for the touch of sweetness",
				"Just to confirm, do you freeze it after letting it sit in the fridge overnight, or before that?",
				"Hi, I was making a half batch, but I can&#8217;t achieve the smooth dough with 2 cup all purpose and 3/4 water. Should I add more water?",
				"Wow!  What an arrogant jerk you are sir!!!!\nBloody hell!",
				"Question about fridge storing. I left the dough in the fridge for 3 days because&#8230; Reasons. I pinched it down once during the 3 days. On day 3 I took it out and I noticed a sour odor and a small amount of hootch like a sourdough starter. Has this happened to you and did you still use the dough?",
				"Oh man, this recipe was a total dud for me! I&#8217;m posting in hopes anyone has some advice.\nI have been making a lot of homemade pizza since March and they have all turned out amazing but this is the first overnight dough i have made and it was awful, so if anyone who hasnt tried making this yet is reading it, please beware. \nThis recipe seemed doomed from the start, are the water and flour ratios correct? When I put in 1.5cups water and FOUR cups of flour it was just a hard lumpy mass. Literally unkneadable, and looked nothing like the nice wet slack dough in the video. I triple read the instructions after to make sure I didn&#8217;t misread anything but alas, that is in fact the ratio. Just to get the dough to a kneadable state, i had to basically double the water amount. I had a feeling from this time that it was in trouble but i still followed all the instructions and wait times just in case a miracle happened (it did not).\nAfter the overnight rise, when i took the dough ball out it wasnt a cohesive dough, you could clearly separate the dough from where i folded it onto itself from the day before (again, i think the dough was too dry despite my extra water). After priming my oven, i stretch the dough, topped it, and baked.\nThe pizza was edible, but the dough was just so dense and hard and didnt rise very much at all. I may try and make it again just to see but I also dont want to waste ingredients. \nI did double check my measurements and this has never been a problem for me with any of the other multiple recipes i have used.",
				"Hi!\nI\u2019ve been no the hunt to make the perfect pizza dough, so I\u2019m very excited to try this recipe! I don\u2019t have instant yeast, only Red Star Active Dry Yeast. How would you recommend I modify this recipe until I can get instant yeast?\nThank you.",
				"Could you add olive oil to this dough recipe please?",
				"Hi I\u2019m looking to prepare pizza bases ahead of a party for around 30 people, say 50 individual 9 inch pizzas?\nWhat would you recommend to limit work on the day? Can I \u2018roll\u2019 or stretch the bases the day before and keep refrigerated- would I put these on greaseproof paper/keep them oiled?\nWe will be using our outdoor kitchen to cook &#8211; a kamado BBQ and a dedicated wood burning pizza oven with stone &#8211; any tips to ensure a thin crust that doesn\u2019t stick?\nWe plan to practise loads in the time running up to it &#8211; do you have a video that goes long with this recipe? Thanks \ud83d\ude42",
				"Gary Hewett&#8217;s recipe can&#8217;t be all that great if he&#8217;s looking for a new and improved dough recipe. I have just popped my dough in the fridge for tomorrow night. Thank you for the recipe,and advice.",
				"Hello, will this dough work with wholewheat flour?",

				"do you pre bake the dough before adding the toppings and sauce? and how long should i bake the pizza for ?",
				"I am planning to try this recipe later this week. Should I use the convection function or regular? Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
				"I found my house was a bit cold for the yeast to rise I think &#8211; after 2 hours it hadn&#8217;t done much. I heated my oven to 105f, turned it off, and stuck my covered bowl in and voila &#8211; an hour later I had lots of rise!",
				"Oops! Wrote this in the review!\nAbsolutely loved the dough! I made the exact recipe and made two dough balls. We had one tonight and the other one we want to save to make two calzones. If so, would you recommend cooking at the same time as the pizza, 550? Anyways, delicious recipe. Thank you!!!",
				"All I have on hand is rapid rise yeast. Could I lower the amount of yeast, let\u2019s say 1/8  Tsp. Of rapids rise since that\u2019s all I have on hand for this recipe. I can\u2019t get my hands a regular yeast. they are sold out everywhere because of covid-19 lockdown. Thank you, stay safe and god bless!!",
				"I like to use fresh ground flour, do you have any suggestions for variations using fresh ground hard winter wheat?  I also live in Colorado so higher hydration in dough is essential, otherwise the water evaporates during the rise and doughs are too dry.  Thank you for any tips! I will be making this dough for family pizza dinner for Easter!!  The kids all get to top their own pizza.",
				"My sourdough starter is having an off day so I tried out this recipe instead! However I used fresh yeast..  hope this doesn&#8217;t upset the recipe too much. \nThe dough seems incredibly wet though and I can&#8217;t stop it sticking all over my hands resulting in dough covered flour bags!\nI&#8217;m now waiting for  an hour for it to rise before shaping it into 3 then leaving in the fridge for dinner tomorrow.  I hope it will be a bit more manageable! \nWish me luck! \ud83d\ude00",
				"Is there any way to substitute an ingredient for yeast?  Don&#8217;t have any on hand in my pantry.",
				"Trying my hand at this now, I wish there were more pictures for each step. I make bread a lot, but this is my first time making pizza dough. How much of a rise should I be expecting? For bread it&#8217;s very visible, but so far I don&#8217;t see much of anything with my dough. Right now I&#8217;m at the 1-2 hour bulk fermentation. \nAlso, when putting the balls into the fridge, will they stay in balls or kind of flatten out? Will the continue to rise while in the fridge? I&#8217;m trying to figure out the best way to do it because I made 3 batches so I will have a total of 6 balls. It seems easier to put them all onto a floured baking sheet rather than 6 plates, but I don&#8217;t want to do that and then have them all flatten out and lump together.. What are your thoughts? Thanks!",
				"My dough has not risen at all.",
				"I had great success with this, especially with a steel. I&#8217;m making it again, but I still don&#8217;t quite understand the &#8220;shaping the dough&#8221; step. I don&#8217;t know what shape I&#8217;m supposed to end up with when storing it for a few days. Am I stretching it then reforming to a ball? \nAlso do you think you could freeze this?",
				"Wow, I&#8217;m astonished that someone would be so rude!",
				"Gary,\n    Your critique is as bad as your parent&#8217;s failure to raise a kind and intelligent human being. Please kindly return to what ever troll cave you were born in and stay away from us humans, thanks.",
				"As someone that is an accomplished pizza-bread maker, I tried the overnight pizza dough recipe to see how it stacked up against my regular dough and was fully underwhelmed. I can only assume the worst, such as that, these amazed at the results of overnight pizza dough makers are the same people that make up the contestants on the Americas Worst Cooks show! I was up for a new and improved dough recipe but this wasn&#8217;t it. I can do much better with my regular method in a few hours.It had very little to recommend as an improvement, 1 item actually. The dough was pliable and easy to work, but had no flavor to add to the finished pizza! Certainly not worth the added effort. Get a Pizza stone an a oven that will hold 500 degrees, for your best shot at it. An additional issue might be that low expectations!!!",
				"Your pizza dough looks absolutely perfect. Will have to give this a try.",
				"Can you use all purpose gluten free flour?  I have not perfected a gf pizza . Yet",
				"What vegan cheese did you use for this pizza?",
				"I\u2019m planning to make a large batch for a party and had few questions. When making a large batch of dough , did you do any additional kneading before bulk fermentation, or just put the dough in fridge? Did you shape the balls the day you make pizzas and use it immediately or did you let it warm  up and ferment some more before shaping?",
				"I agree. I search and search and wish I could find this exact kind of recipe (slow rise/ferment in the fridge) but just want a yield of one pizza. It obviously saves time to make a big batch but I can&#8217;t get through three pizzas in as many days and I&#8217;ve had rotten luck with freezing and defrosting pizza dough.",
				"I wish this recipe instructed on the amount of ingredients for just one pizza. I don&#8217;t want or need multiple doughs.",
				"I was planning to make pizza for a party of around 50 freinds and needed to make the dough a day before. Found this recipe and it was perfect. I made *10 the quantity in one batch, which was tough, but made around 15-18 14&#8243; pizzas (I lost count) In a steel pizza oven. I didn&#8217;t separate the dough into individual pizzas before hand because of the quantity, instead I kept it in 2 halfs in large bags with plenty oil, which was fine. The dough was the best I have made and everyone at the party went crazy for it, so much air in the crust. The main plus of this is how good it tastes and that thin or thick crust are both delicious, which is not always th case (with some recipes favouring thin or thick). From now on this will be my go to recipe. Thanks a lot for making the part a success. Wish I could share photos.",
				"This was wonderful! We made a deep dish and two thins with the recipe. No one knew it was a vegan recipe until I told them. The instructions were easy to follow and the taste was fantastic. Thank you for helping this journey of a new lifestyle (no dairy and no eggs) be one that is easier to do than I thought.",
				"Thanks for the recipe!\nI am planning to prepare dough for 10 people, each having their own 10&#8243; pizza. Would you recommend tripling the recipe to fit this quantity?\nI will also be cooking these over campfire coals in cast iron pans, oiled, and covered with aluminum foil. I was planning to use the high heat of direct contact with the coals and to cook for about 5 minutes. Do you have any insight into how I may best achieve thoroughly cooked dough?\nThanks again!",
				"Hi! Can you freeze the dough if you dont use it all?",
				"We do pizza every Friday so I can&#8217;t wait to try this out! It looks so easy!",
				"Great recipe? Have you tried using bread flour?",
				"I rarely review recipes, but I made this on Tuesday night, so that Wednesday evening I&#8217;d have a simple meal ready to go. I loved this crust, and mind you I did not follow the recipe perfectly, nor did I have the peel nor the stone. I just used a square small baking sheet, oiled it up, topped it and baked it. The crust was nicely crisped, with lovely coloring and such a nice flavor. I&#8217;ve made a lot of pizza dough recipes, but this one worked great with the limitations I had. AND THANK YOU for posting grams. I much prefer to make dough by weight instead of volume. \nAlso can I just mention how much I love pizza for using up the scraps? I had a cup of homemade spaghetti sauce left, which turned into pizza sauce. Some leftover shredded chicken, from the stock I had made for chicken noodle soup. And some languishing spinach in my fridge. One pizza was turned into bbq chicken + pineapple pizza. The other was spinach and anchovy.",
				"1/4 tsp of instant yeast? Seems very low. No sugar?",
				"..FLOUR&#8230;LOL?",
				"&#8230; have you ever used active sourdough starter in this pizza dough and can I use bread flower I also have double zero from Italy that&#8217;s actually made for pizza have a great night..!!?????"

				"1. Mix together the ingredients for the tangzhong, 28g (3 tbsp) flour and 113g (1/2 cup) plant milk. Heat in a pot on the stove, whisking, until it thickens to a paste. Or microwave in increments of 20-30 seconds, whisking between each one, until it thickens to a paste.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl (or bowl for the stand mixer) combine the cooked paste and the rest of the plant milk. Stir to distribute and check the temperature. It should feel lukewarm and be under 110 \u00baF, otherwise let it cool to this point.",
				"3. Add the water, sugar, salt, potato flour or Ener-G Egg Replacer, and instant yeast and whisk to dissolve. If using active dry yeast let it sit for about 10 minutes until it gets a little foamy.",
				"4. Add the bread flour and mix with a wooden spoon or your clean, wet hand to form a shaggy dough. Let sit and autolyse for 20-30 minutes.",
				"5. Add the softened vegan butter to the dough. Knead the dough in a stand mixer, bread machine, or by hand (adding flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking) for 10 minutes. The dough will first incorporate the vegan butter, then turn slippery, then the gluten will develop and turn into a supple and soft dough. If kneading by machine, turn the dough out onto a counter and knead for 30-60 seconds to make any last adjustments with flour if needed. Shape into a ball.",
				"6. Add some oil to a large mixing bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer and turn the dough in the oil to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rise for about 60-90 minutes or until double in size.",

				"8. To shape the dough: press into a rectangle, then fold the sides in like an envelope. Flatten the rectangle, then roll the short edge up like a jelly roll. To make a bun shape, cup your hand over the dough and move your hand in a circle to roll the bun into a ball shape. To make a hot dog bun: roll the jelly roll back and forth under your flattened hands to make it 5-6\" long. If making a simple bread roll, skip both of these last steps.",
				"9. Place the shaped dough onto a parchment lined baking tray, leaving a few inches between each roll. Cover and let rise for 30-40 minutes until about 1 1/2 the size.",
				"10. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF about 20 minutes before baking.",
				"11. If you wish to stick seeds on your buns, combine 2 tsp of potato flour or Ener-G Egg Replacer in a microwave safe dish and microwave for 30-45 seconds checking and stirring every 10 seconds until thickened. Right before baking the buns, brush them with the starch mixture and then sprinkle with poppy seeds.",
				"12. Bake the buns for 25-30 minutes or until they are a pale golden brown. Enjoy fresh the same day, subsequent days warm up in the oven or toast before eating."

				"Hi Eva! Thanks for sharing this dish. My partner and I love tofu and I\u2019m always looking for good recipes. Anyway, I made the coconut tofu with a few additions: after coating the tofu pieces with the flax egg and the shredded coconut, I did a heavy sprinkle of salt, garlic, and paprika powder, and a light sprinkle of cayenne and onion powder before they were fried/baked. I found these added flavors really brought out the texture and taste of the shredded coconuts. \nThank you! !",
				"I love this coconut encrusted tofu, it&#8217;s amazing! Thanks for offering two different ways to cook it &#8211; I almost always fry tofu but this time I baked it. It was less messy, used less oil, and tastes just as good! The wasabi sauce is awesome, too. Thank you!",
				"This looks so delicious! I love wasabi so much and have some paste in the fridge but I can never think of anything to use it on.  I can&#8217;t wait to try it out with this!",
				"What a gorgeous poke bowl! That tofu looks to die for! You had me at wasabi \ud83d\ude42"

				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF with a rack positioned in the center. Prepare two 8\" round pans: spray the pans with oil, then place round parchment paper on the bottom.",
				"2. In a large mixing bowl add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Whisk together until combined and fluffy.",
				"3. In a second mixing bowl add the oil, maple syrup, plant milk, vanilla extract, chocolate extract (if using), and apple cider vinegar. Whisk together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry whisk until smooth and lump free.",
				"4. Divide the batter into the prepared baking pans then tap the pans on the counter 2-3 times to release some of the air bubbles. Place the pans in the center of the oven and bake for 32-34 minutes. When done, a tester will come out clean or with a couple of crumbs and the edges of the cake will have pulled away from the edge of the pan.",
				"5. Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to fully cool. Remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake when transferring.",
				"6. When cool, move the cake onto a cardboard round and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Store this in the fridge until chilled.",
				"7. Combine the blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and dried lavender in a pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, mashing the berries to break them up. Then turn down and let simmer for about 15 minutes (may take less time if using fresh berries), or until a spoon can run through the pot and the jam takes a second before filling in behind it. Let cool completely, or make in advance and refrigerate until ready to use.",
				"8. Whisk together the flour and plant milk in a small pot until smooth. Turn the heat on to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Keep whisking continuously until the pudding thickens. Turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. Whisk occasionally as it cools to keep it smooth.",
				"9. Blitz the sugar in a blender for a few seconds to make a superfine sugar.",
				"10. In a large mixing bowl with electric beaters or using a stand mixer with paddle attachment, whip the vegan butter and sugar until fluffy.",
				"11. Add the pudding in batches, whipping after each one to incorporate. Once all of it has been added, whip the frosting until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and beat it in.",

Add fresh black berries (cut in half or use smaller berries) if you'd like. Repeat with the remaining layers.",
				"15. After adding the last layer, frost the top with the remaining buttercream and swirl in some blackberry lavender jam to marble the top. Decorate with fresh berries and flowers if you'd like.",

				"3. Add the garlic and nuts to a food processor. Pulse to grind into fine crumbs. Add the basil, thyme, and parsley and process to finely chop. Add the salt and drizzle in the olive oil and process to combine and puree as finely as you'd like. Add the lemon juice and pulse to combine. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
				"4. Turn the oven to 550 \u00baF, or as hot as it will go. Place a rack one third of the way down from the top of the oven, and place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack. You want the oven to saturate with heat for about 1 hour before baking pizza for best results.",

				"2. Sanitize everything that will come into contact with the cheese mixture by rinsing with boiling hot water. Pour it over the blender or food processor, including the blades, lid, and tamper stick--anything that will touch the cashew cheese. Pour it over the measuring cups, the silicon spatula (ideally with a wooden or silicon handle), and the glass bowl you will culture in, including its lid if it has one. Pour off the boiling hot water once it's rinsed and scalded every surface and let the steam mostly evaporate (its ok if a little water is left behind). Be careful not to burn yourself with the water when you do this.",

Blend or process until smooth, using the tamper to keep the mixture moving if applicable, or pausing to scrape down periodically. If needed add up to 1/4 cup extra distilled water to make a smooth and thick cream.",
				"4. Transfer the thick cashew cream to the sanitized glass bowl using the sanitized silicon spatula. Add the probiotic and mix in to combine using the spatula. Sprinkle a small amount of salt over the top (this inhibits any undesirable mold) and cover using the lid of the glass bowl or plastic wrap.",
				"5. Leave out on the counter to culture for 1-3 days. Stir once every 12-24 hours using a sanitized rubber spatula, sprinkling a bit of salt over the top after each time. Taste after 1 day, and let culture until you reach your desired level of tangy-sourness. The cheese will thicken as it cultures. Culturing will take longer when the kitchen is cold and shorter when the kitchen is very warm.",
				"6. Once cultured to taste, add in the nutritional yeast and salt. It's ok for metal to touch the mixture at this point. Taste and add more salt if desired.",
				"7. At this point add in any mix-ins you like, then refrigerate. It will firm up after being refrigerated for several hours. The cheese will keep for at least 1-2 weeks."

				"I made the cheese and it turned out perfect. I let it sit 2 days. I stirred it twice a day and sprinkled the salt on top. It didnt need that final 1/2 teaspoon. I was pretty liberal with the salt. I added the nutritional yeast and it rounded out the flavor nicely. Im going to take part of it and add some herbs and maybe garlic to create a variation. I used the probiotic you suggested. Your link has a newer version with a prebiotic so I went to whole foods and they had some of the original without the prebiotic. It had a clearance sticker on the shelf, so I guess the company is discontinuing it. Thank you for your recipe, its helping to keep me vegan. Not eating dairy cheese has been hard until now.",
				"Hi Eva,\nI recently tried cashew cheese, and I LOVE IT! Your recipe looks yummy. From the pictures, it looks like you are using raw cashews. For clarification&#8230;Do I use raw cashews?",
				"So, the affiliate link you have for the probiotic has FOS, which is fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic. ? Is that the one you actually use?  \nHave you ever vacuum-sealed the cheese? I\u2019m wondering how long that would extend the shelf-life. I love Miyoko\u2019s vegan cheese, but it\u2019s so expensive and we used to have a great variety of flavors, but my local natural food store has cut way back. It would be fun to try my own and make a few wheels in different flavors. I\u2019m also going to try doing it with almonds because I\u2019ve just found out my son is allergic to cashews.",
				"Thanks Eva! No problem at all on the delay. I was waiting for the heat wave we\u2019d been having to end anyway because every time I try to make something fermented or cultured in this weather it gets a little too funky a little too fast! ?\nI like the advice to do 2/3 of the recipe. Will attempt later this week if the weather forecast isn\u2019t lying and let you know how it goes!",
				"Hey Eva,\nFinally got my hands on some vegan probiotic capsules (hard to find up here in Canada for some reason!) and keen to try making this cheese!\nPossibly a dumb question, but can I halve this recipe? (I have a Vitamix with a regular size blender jar\u2014seriously considering investing in the 32 oz one!).\nthanks!",
				"Hi Eva,\nthank you for your hard work! I really appreciate all the detailed information and the recipes (different flavours)\nKeep up the good work"

				"Made this recipe and it was very good.  I did add a bit more salt and basil to the ricotta as the taste was not pronounced enough and also a squeeze of lemon juice which gave it even more freshness.  Overall, great recipe and will make it again.",
				"Hi, since the pea ricotta makes double what is needed for the recipe, can it be frozen to use another time? Thank you. MJ",
				"This was really tasty and a huge success, even in my omnivorous, cheese-loving, household! Even the child who despises peas went for a second helping.\nAs a variation, I&#8217;ve played with the ricotta recipe by soaking the cashews for a few hours (makes it creamier if you have the extra time) and added 2 tsp each of lemon juice and lemon zest for a bit more acidity to offset the spicy noodles. So good!",

The first time I made it, 8 cups of water worked well but since then it\u2019s way too much.\n    We are in the middle of our monsoon season (we\u2019re high desert the rest of the time\u2014VERY dry).  It\u2019s raining 2-3 times as much as any monsoon season I can remember.  Everything\u2019s completely soaked!  I share this because it might explain why some of us need 8 cups of water and others need less.  My experience:  Pre-monsoon;  8 cups\u2026now(major league monsoon); 6 cups is almost too much.\n   Thanks again for a delightful recipe.",

				"What a great recipe!  I used the 8 cups in a La Cruiset style pot.  It seemed like too much water but after cooking, the lentils thickened and I ended up with a fairly thick dal.  This is the first tadka I\u2019ve ever made but It certainly won\u2019t be the last.

I had to rinse half a kilo (again, I&#8217;m Russian, if you want to conquer European market, it has to be in grams and Celsius, we google all that memorize it in the end, but it&#8217;s annoying and we go straight to the Jamie Oliver&#8217;s site instead) of rice and lentils to get it clear in a small sieve. Jesus, the patience it takes. Thank god I was drinking wine.\nThe tendency of the European market is the same as the US healthy one: the extreme opposite of fast food and the usual potato/meat cuisine (depends on the country though). The Czech one where I lived for 6 years has the most vegan and raw food one (!) in European.\nI added a bit of smoked paprika, smoked salt and za&#8217;atar, turned out to be real f*cking nice.\nBest of luck to you getting subscribers, you&#8217;re worth it.

I drained water from lentils early  because I worried they were going to overcook but then I realized they weren\u2019t thick like the photo and I probably should have cooked more before dumping the water.

Also the comments and responses about draining water off, adding salt, and blending as an option were really helpful too. Thank you for sharing your recipes!",
				"It says that the recipe produces 8 servings, I was wondering what size this serving might be.",
				"Hi Eva! This recipe sounds delicious and I&#8217;m hoping to try it tomorrow. If I prefer a thicker consistency would 3 cups of water be okay or would it no longer be authentic? I tried another dal recipe tonight using 4 cups of liquid and 1 1/2 cups red lentils but it was much too thin for my liking. Wondering if maybe I cooked it wrong but figured when I try again it might be better to start with less liquid and add more as needed. Thank you for your help!",
				"Thank you for this recipe! I tried quite a few different dal recipes this year, but this one is my favorite! So good! Used 6 cups of water since I like it a bit thicker. Perfection. Food that makes people happy!",
				"I have tried a few recipes of urs and the results were superb. Thanks for ur recipes",
				"Thank you for this recipe!!!! I&#8217;ve tried my first lentil dal in university, in the dining hall and have been trying to make it at from since then!!! This is the first recipe that WORKS and really satisfies that craving. I&#8217;m over the moon right now. \ud83d\ude42 Thank you!!! &lt;3\nBtw, does it freeze well? I made the full amount and live alone so&#8230; XD",
				"I love this recipe! I like mine on the thick side so I reduce the water.",
				"I think people are &#8220;hangry&#8221; and just want to get straight to the recipe.  I know I really had to search for it and almost gave up!  Glad I did not give up, finally found it, made it and it is delish !  Thanks.",
				"I made this tonight for dinner and it turned out delicious! All of your recipes on your website look so good. I will be trying more soon! I used Serrano peppers and it was just the right level of spiciness for the family. Thank you so much for sharing.",
				"I didn&#8217;t have green chilis so I substituted dried red chili flakes. I also wasn&#8217;t sure what was meant by Indian curry powder.  We only know the American curry kind.  I replaced that with masala. I had just bought a bag of roma tomatoes so I used a little bit over a cup of those. The results were excellent.  I&#8217;m very pleased to have this new recipe.\nThank you!",
				"I just love Indian Food!\nYour recipe sounds great, but I would consider adding a bit of Grounded Fennel, an appropriate (a quarter teaspoon) amount of finely chopped Lime Pickle and a pinch of Saffron to the tadka. As for the amount of water, i would think it might be better if you start with at least 5 cups of water and add more if the dhal is to thick for your taste.\nThank you so much for your recipe!",
				"I love dal \u2013 It can be so comforting especially during cold weather. Thank you for sharing!",
				"I love the recipe.  I\u2019ve had it several times and it was great.  I love it thinner as your recipe is perfect for that.",
				"Thank you for the recipe. Overall, it was easy to make. I found it less flavorful than I expected. I even double the ginger and coriander.  At the end, I added about 4 Tbsp tomato paste and an additional Tsp of curry powder.",
				"I pretty much never comment but I just had to say how much i enjoyed this! It was the first time I&#8217;ve ever used red lentils. I used jalapenos, Rani hot curry powder, and a bit less water and it&#8217;s the perfect flavor. First time I&#8217;ve ever cooked dal and I can safely say I don&#8217;t need to try any other recipes!",
				"This was definitely too much water and not enough flavor. I think 5 or 6 cups of water would&#8217;ve been sufficient. I had to add the rest of my lentils in (maybe another cup or 2) and 2 potatoes to thicken it. I stopped measuring spices and just started adding to taste. The measured amount were hardly noticeable when added to the lentils with its extra water. I nearly added another can of diced tomatoes but opted against it\u2014I think either way would&#8217;ve been fine. Don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll be using this recipe again.",
				"I\u2019ve had trouble finding red lentils anywhere because of the pandemic. Would green lentils work fine for this recipe? What would I have to tweak?",
				"Amazing recipe!  Followed the ingredients and recipe except I drained the lentils because I wanted a thicker dal.  My family loved it!",
				"I used 1:2 ratio lentils to water. I added my 1/4tsp of salt to lentil water instead of the food when cooking it\u2019s more bang for the buck salt wise and I don\u2019t like to use a lot of salt. Added  1 bay leaf to water and a slice of onion.. this helps the lentil have a flavor before adding to onion mix because lentils are flavor sucker uppers.. so it is always better to give salt and mild flavor to lentil in their own pot..",
				"I can&#8217;t understand why you would be disappointed if you made it correctly, but using a little common sense works wonders.  Cooking involves &#8216;tasting&#8217; every so often and should always be an adventure.  It sounds like you are beginning to branch out of your comfort zone, because if you were an experienced cook, you would have known to tweak it.\n     If you ARE a beginner, then count this as a learning process and figure out what went wrong.  I made this and it was incredible!  Just because a recipe is &#8216;out there&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s going to be perfect for every one, every time.. be nice, work it out and add something constructive as a comment next time!",
				"Hey Eva!\nYour recipe is an absolute dream! \ud83d\ude42 Thank you so much for sharing, and I really enjoyed reading all the information prior to the recipe! Its become a weekly staple and such a good recipe to start adding in little things to experiment! (i love stirring in some spinach and kale towards the end).",
				"V delicious.\nMight just add a cup less water next time as the consistency may have been a bit too runny for my liking! \nOtherwise, utterly GORGEOUS.",
				"Thanks so much! I did add water and it worked. Just a gorgeous recipe. My family loved it as well &#8211; first time eating dal for my kids. I&#8217;m going to try many more recipes from your site.",
				"Eva, hello! This recipe tastes fabulous. However, it does not have enough liquid. I think I was not supposed to drain the lentils, which I did.  Can I add water to fix?",
				"This is my go to dahl recipe! I use half the amount of lentils and 3 1/2 cups water, also adding turmeric and garam masala. I use more than half of the spices (although under half tbsp curry powder due to added spices) as I enjoy the stronger flavour. I also blend some of the onion/spice/tomato mixture for a smoother dahl. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Hi Eva. I have been looking for a tasty dhal recipe for a while. What better place to start than from a namesake. I will let you know how I get on.",
				"I, too, was worried about the amount of water listed. I did cook the lentils in the full 8 cups listed but then I drained most of it &#8211; probably 6 cups &#8211; off. I like a thicker dal  and figured I could add it back in slowly if I needed to. This worked perfectly for me and the flavors only get better as it sits. Thanks !",
				"Great recipe thanks!  My first time making Dal.  I could only find green lentils and they didn&#8217;t cook down much so I blended half of them for a more soup texture.  The tadka was so good and aromatic I almost hated to add anything to it.  I will definitely be making this again and look forward to making it with red lentils next time.",
				"Winter in Cape Town pairs perfectly with this delicious authentic Dal!! So glad I found your recipe. Had all the ingredients and followed your method to the T! Thanks for sharing ?",
				"May I know how long can you keep the cooked dal in the fridge? Thanks!",
				"You know, I loved the commentary as I am a learner in the field of Dal. I super appreciated the whys and wherefores. I failed last night with yellow split peas which were still crunchy after 3 hours of cooking so was looking for a red lentil recipe. I\u2019ll also cook the lentils separately in future before adding to the good stuff. This is pretty standard format, V. Most of us know that the recipe is to be found at the bottom.  So don\u2019t hesitate to use your thumbs next time.",
				"I\u2019ve had trouble finding red lentils anywhere because of the pandemic. Would green lentils work fine for this recipe? What would I have to tweak?",
				"Can you replace the curry powder with anything else? Or leave it out altogether?",
				"If you have a stick blender, use that for the entire lot of dal after tadka!!!",
				"When you say \u201ccurry powder\u201d what specifically do you mean? What type of curry powder? Garam masala?",
				"Lovely, nuanced reply to a very rude person&#8230;one who probably didn&#8217;t deserve your kindness. And delicious recipe, too. Thank you.",
				"I haven&#8217;t tried this recipe yet (planning on doing so tonight) so I can&#8217;t really evaluate whether it&#8217;s too much water or not. It sounds like it&#8217;s a lot of water though, and I&#8217;ll probably start with 6 cups and add more if it&#8217;s too thick.\nAnyway, I always translate 1 cup to 2\u00bd dl for simplicity, meaning 2 cups are 5 dl (or a half litre) and 8 cups are 2 litres.",
				"Made this for the first time today. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It\u2019s was absolutely delicious. And to top it of we had a lovely chai tea made with condensed milk afterwards.",
				"Drain off the extra liquid and reserve it. Then you can add it back in to the desired consistency.",
				"Awesome!\nI have experimented with several dahl recipies and this is the best yet.\nA few tweeks, if I may&#8230;\n1.  Added a vegetable stock cube to the lentils.\n2.  Added a teaspoon of concentrated lemon juice for that classic tanginess!\nReally like the author&#8217;s writing style.  Explains everything clearly without assuming that the reader is familiar with specific terms."

I used all purpose flour instead of the garbanzo blend (I didn\u2019t have any)  and frangelico instead of whiskey and it turned out great!  I was honestly hesitant about the cream filling- it seemed like it would be so heavy with all the  coconut oil, but it was actually so light and fluffy!! The cake was not too sweet, either- it was all perfect. Very time consuming to make, but over all, super  easy and worth the time and effort. Everyone was so impressed!!  Oh- I was also worried about not having enough crepes because it took me a while to get the hang of it and I lost my first 3- this recipe seemed to account for that and I still had 17 layers!!

The only thing I would change is make the meatballs a tiny bit smaller so they can cook faster and get a little more crispy. Sauce was divine too, next time I am doubling that! That sauce would be amazing in so many dishes or even as a soup. Hahaha\nThank you!",
				"Turned out great! I had cooked farro on hand so i used that as the grain. Didn\u2019t need to use the breadcrumbs but did need a tad more olive oil to give the mix more moisture. Used fresh basil in the sauce and served it all over zoodles. Was a big hit with the hubby, will definitely make it again!",

It didn&#8217;t happen to me &#8211; the balls were quite solid and I even left one of them still soaking in the sauce in the fridge for the night (just to test) and it was pretty solid in the morning. What might have helped in my case is that I intentionally overcooked rice and made it just a tiny bit slushy and so the rice helped chickpeas to bind well. Try it.\nThe sauce was great too! I added some turmeric for the color because my peppers were rather white.\nThe most important thing is that my meat loving husband loved the chickpeas balls! I always warn him when I make something vegan and ask him to tell the truth if he doesn&#8217;t like it.  I warned him this time too but he really loved them and even asked for the leftovers to be packed for lunch. It was quite unfortunate because I was going to finish them myself the next day lol.",

I would also caution anyone using a food processor about how dense this mix gets.  Not all food processors can handle it.  I almost feel as though it might be best to do the nuts separately from the chickpeas and mix them together later on.",

				"Can the meatballs be frozen?",
				"These just did not work for me. The chickpea balls were pappy with little texture. It seems a waste to add the nuts right at the beginning when they would add some noce texture if you added them with the last few chickpeas.\nThe sauce however was even worse. Way too much coconut milk which overpowered everything. \nI wont be making these again",

I made the sauce in the food processor. I thought I would save a step and take out one less piece of equipment. The texture would be better if made in the blender as suggested. .  Well done!!!  Will put this in my regular rotation.",
				"This is a fantastic recipe! I\u2019m in love with these \u201cmeatballs\u201d and the sauce is addicting!",

It was a meal that came together quickly and made us feel full and well nourished.  I&#8217;m looking forward to leftovers for lunch!  Thank you for the recipe.",
				"What is the purpose of the nutritional yeast?  Is it for flavor or some other reason? I ask because my husband doesn&#8217;t like the flavor of it but if I leave it out I suppose I&#8217;ll need something else.",
				"Another great recipe thank you. I have made this and froze most of the balls for another time.",
				"Delicious!  I&#8217;ve been looking forward to making this for a day or two, and the flavor was just what I was hoping for.  My meatballs didn&#8217;t end up holding their form once I put them in the sauce.  Should I have baked them longer or could it be because I didn&#8217;t cool the meatballs before putting them in the sauce?",
				"I made this and it&#8217;s DELICIOUS!!!! I took the leftover meatballs out of the sauce to save for later. The &#8220;meatballs&#8221; warmed up nicely in the airfryer.! I topped with the warmed leftover sauce. I just had a question&#8230;.how many meatballs are considered a serving and do you have the nutritional info?",
				"Hi Eva,\nI have measured 3:c of chickpeas, however when I weigh them it equals 15-7/8 ounces.. Do I use 3 cups or weigh out 30 ounces?\nThanks,\nSusie",
				"Delicious! I made it with cashews because my daughter is allergic to pecans. Changed out the seasoning too&#8230;used paprika, turmeric, cumin, and coriander instead of the Italian seasoning listed in the recipe. The dish was a big hit! Thank you!",

			"recipe": [
				"1. Set up a large steamer pot on the stove and bring water to a boil, turning down the heat to maintain a steamy simmer.",
				"2. To a blender add tofu, sun dried tomatoes, vegetable broth, oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, garlic cloves, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and rosemary. Blend until fairy smooth, small bits of sun dried tomato are ok.",
				"3. In a mixing bowl whisk together the vital wheat gluten, chickpea flour, and corn starch. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir to bring together with a wooden spoon. Then knead by hand for 1-3 minutes to thoroughly mix together and slightly develop the gluten.",
				"4. Prepare a large piece of foil, about 10\" long. Place a piece of parchment paper, about 6\" long in the center of the foil (see photos in post). Place the seitan dough about 1/3 of the way up from the edge of the parchment paper and form into about a 6\" log. Wrap the parchment paper around the seitan, then place it towards the bottom of the foil and wrap the foil around it and twist the ends like a candy wrapper to tightly seal the foil package.",
				"5. Place in the steamer basket and let steam for 1 hour. In the last 15 minutes, preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF. After an hour of steaming, transfer the seitan loaf (still in the foil) to a baking tray and bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely, unsealing the foil to speed the process once it's cool enough to touch.",
				"6. Once room temperature, seal in a container or plastic bag and store in the fridge, it will continue to firm up over the next several hours. Thinly slice, chop, shred, or prepare however you like. For longer storage it keeps well in the freezer, but remove foil before freezing."

				"I made this and it was GREAT!!   I didn&#8217;t have enough sun dried tomatoes so that flavor didn&#8217;t come through as I would have liked but it was still delicious. I am excited to make another loaf with the full amount since I love sun dried tomatoes.  I am making a version today with mushrooms and balsamic vinegar (like Field Roast version.)  I know I will be making many versions of this recipe! lol  It is easy to make and to me tastes better than the store-bought versions.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!  I am excited to check out your other recipes.",
				"Hi there. I&#8217;m eager to try this but wanted to ask a question. I just made the original recipe from Vegan Dad (didn&#8217;t realize yours was a modification of his) and the loaf looked amazing when I took it out of the oven: full, round, and very loaf-like. I opened the foil to let it cool, then walked away for about 10 minutes, and when I came back the loaf had deflated into a wrinkly mound. It&#8217;s still edible but I won&#8217;t get the nice round slices I was hoping for. Before I try again with your version, is there something I should do differently to ensure my loaf stays intact?",
				"what can I sub for wheat gluten? cant do that",
				"Amazing! I added chili flakes and I used smoked tofu&#8230;.Really Great taste with \u201cPizza al Testo\u201d",
				"Delicious! I added 1 tsp liquid smoke and 1/2 tsp MSG (Ac&#8217;cent) to up the &#8220;meatiness&#8221; a little bit, but I don&#8217;t think it really needed it. \nI like Tofurky slices but they&#8217;re so expensive; I feel like I have to make a really wimpy sandwich to keep from wasting money. This is a lot cheaper, plus it was a fun way to spend my lunch break during COVID-19 quarantine.\nI can verify Shannon&#8217;s account that 35 min in the Instant Pot (plus the oven bake as written) works out great. It just barely fit in my 6 qt. cooker. Put the loaf on top of the steamer rack and don&#8217;t forget to add at least 2 cups water to the bottom!",
				"We made this as written, using a combination of roasted garlic and seasoned vegetable Better Than Bouillon to make the broth. I really like the idea of wrapping the loaf to keep it dense. We put it in the Trager to bake, opening the foil to smoke it about five minutes at the end. We made sandwiches with it, and thought the taste was reminiscent of meatloaf. It made wonderful sandwiches! We have tried different vegan sliced sandwich &#8220;meat&#8221; and found then to be inedible, so we are thrilled to have something we really like! We are looking forward to experimenting with the seasonings, and thank you for sharing this!",
				"I made this earlier in the week. So very good! And not hard to make! I love that everything is blended together &#8211; makes it very simple. I didn\u2019t have the parchment paper, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter &#8211; just rolled it in two layers of aluminum foil. It is a bit of waiting around for it to cook and cool, but the actual hands-on time was pretty minimal.\nI think next time, I may try some different flavor add-ins. I like the idea of some liquid smoke, and something sweet on the outside to make it ham-like. If you have any other ideas, please share! \nOff to try to use it in a Cuban sandwich for lunch (grilled sandwich with these slices, some Chao cheese, pickles and mustard!).",
				"The chickpea flour is really to change the texture so you can miss it out, or just up the amount of tofu.",

				"What cheese is in the photo?  Is that your jalapeno cheese?",
				"Hi!!!\nIf i\u2019 m adding liquid flavors (within the 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth) can I skip the sundried tomatoes or would that change the final texture? \nThank you for your recipes!!!",
				"So I placed my foil packet in the instant pot and cooked on high for 35 minutes instead of steaming. Turned out great! Although maybe a little more dense than what I see in your photos. Will have to try it on the stove again sometime to compare.",
				"So want to make this with the stromboli! Do you think it would be possible to steam it in the instant pot to speed up the time?",
				"How long will this last in refrigerator? And can I freeze it?",

				"1 tbsp (12g) oil",
				"3/4 cups + 1 tbsp (185g) boiling hot water",

				"1/4 cup chopped cilantro (leaves and stems)",
				"1/4 cup (75g) gochujang paste",
				"2 tbsp hot water",
				"1 tbsp toasted sesame oil",
				"1 1/2 tsp soy sauce",
				"sesame seeds for the bottom of the wrappers (optional)"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 25 minutes",
			"serving": "32 dumplings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Prepare the dumpling dough: in a stand mixer bowl combine the flour, salt, oil, and boiling hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine bring into a rough dough. Using the dough hook on a stand mixer knead on low speed for 3 minutes, turn off and let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3 minutes on low speed. ",
				"2. Turn out onto the counter and knead by hand for about 1 minute and make any last adjustments with flour or water to make a smooth and supple dough that's slightly tacky (but not sticky) to the touch. Cover with a damp towel and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes while you prepare the filling. Alternatively you can knead by hand, just let the dough cool enough to not burn your hands and follow the same knead 3m, rest 5m, knead 3m pattern, making adjustments with flour as you knead.",
				"3. Prepare the filling: Heat a skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and add the tofu. Fry for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cabbage, green onion, garlic, plus a pinch of salt and let cook 5-6 minutes until the cabbage has released its water and the mixture has cooked down.",
				"4. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the gochujang paste, hot water, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to form a smooth sauce. Add the sauce to the tofu mixture along with the cilantro, stir to combine then turn off the heat and let cool to room temperature. You can transfer to a plate and put in fridge to speed up the process.",
				"5. Fill and shape the dumplings: Divide the rested dumpling dough into 32 pieces: cut in half, then each half into quarters, and each quarter into quarters to get 32. Keep them covered under the damp towel in the bowl, working with just a few at a time.",
				"6. Lightly dust the counter and roll out each piece of dough individually to make a thin circle, about the size of your palm. Using your finger or a pastry brush, brush a little water just around the edge of the circle, about 1cm thick. Put the wrapper in one hand, and place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper. With your other hand fold the wrapper in half and pinch in the center so it seals, then working towards the edge, pleat one side and press to seal against the opposite side, then work down the other side. You can also create folds starting from one edge and working to the others so that all the pleats fold in the same direction, but this method is a bit more challenging for a beginner. Set aside onto a piece of parchment paper and repeat with remaining pieces of dough.",
				"7. When the dumplings are all shaped, put a thin layer of water in a bowl and pour sesame seeds to cover a small plate. Dip the dumplings in the water then dip into the sesame seeds (this step is optional) and return to the parchment paper.",
				"8. Cook the dumplings: heat a skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or so of oil to coat the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Add dumplings in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Let cook for about 2 minutes, then add 1/4 cup of water (be careful of splattering, hold a lid up to protect you as you pour) and immediately cover the skillet. Let steam for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and if the bottoms are still too light in color, let them continue to cook until golden.",
				"9. Repeat with second and if needed, third batch of dumplings and eat while hot!"

I forgot to check the ingredient list but do you think what is inside the red tub is more paste-like rather than sauce-like??????",

				"This is the best cookie recipe ever. We literally call them \u201cThe Best Cookies In The World\u201d and bake them for friends, family, coworkers all the time. We tend to use mix both miyokos oat butter and coconut oil and found that to be our favorite. Sometimes the butter is salted so we use less salt in that case. Thank you for The Best Cookies In The World recipe! I kinda want to add kettle chips next time \ud83e\udd24",
				"Eva, these are so good!!!",
				"So yummy, followed the recipe using vegan butter. They turned out perfect. I baked 2 trays at once and total baking time was 18 minutes. Bottoms crispy and centers chewy. Thank you for the recipe it\u2019s a keeper.",
				"I really enjoyed these! I used coconut oil and 1 T cornstarch. The edges spread and crisped up a little bit I liked the crispiness with the soft center. Delicious!",
				"Love these cookies! They are perfect. They hit all the marks for a perfect chocolate chip cookie for me, which has been tricky to find as far as vegan cookies go.",
				"I followed the recipe exactly but the cookies ended up very crumbly &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t pick them up without falling apart &#8211;  any recommendations?",
				"I&#8217;ve made these many times. It&#8217;s a very good recipe. Probably my favorite cookie recipe actually! I usually use tahini instead of peanut butter because it&#8217;s what I have on hand.\nThank you for the amazing recipe!!",
				"Can this be made without the oats? I like the oatmeal choco chip pb idea.. but wondering if I wanted just a choco PB cookie?\nwould I need to replace the oats with something?",
				"Can i use shortening in stead of vegan butter?",
				"These are amazing ! I have made them plant based and not plant based and both turned out well. I also used crunchy pb for an extra texture so would recommend!\nSo so so so tasty yum",
				"These are wonderful and will go into my regular rotation of favorites! I used quick oats because it&#8217;s what I had on hand and they worked fine. Mine were done in 8 minutes, maybe due to the small scoop I use. Cookie perfection! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Thoughts on adding choco no no\u2019s (vegan M&amp;M\u2019s) to these to create a monster cookie? These look so flat, I\u2019m wondering if the candies would be too big? \nAlso, what do you think about freezing the dough balls and baking as needed/wanted? I live alone and during quarantine taking the extra to work or neighbors isn\u2019t an option!",
				"Do you flatten them, or just put them in the oven as balls? \ud83d\ude42",
				"I made these once and they were so good!!! I am now waiting for another batch to bake, this time I used less chocolate and more oats! I also added salted peanuts mhmm???",
				"Hi!! I am making these cookies for my boyfriend tonight, but will not be giving them to him until tomorrow. Is it best to store these in the fridge or room temperature after they&#8217;ve already been baked? \nThey look great already! Definitely will be making these again.",
				"These are one of the best cookie recipes I&#8217;ve ever made! It&#8217;s all of my favorite things about both peanut butter and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I swapped coconut sugar for brown sugar (it&#8217;s just what I had) and baker&#8217;s stevia for white sugar to cut down on overall sugar content; I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would work, but it did and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Definitely going to share this recipe with others.",
				"Hi, I was impatient to try this recipe and went with almond butter and unrefined coconut oil, as those were ingredients I had in the house.  I did not use the cornstarch.  Oh my, this is truly a delicious cookie.  I will definitely make them again.  I may add the cornstarch only because there is an oily residue left  on my hand when eating the warm cookie.  Will try to send photos the cookies are picture perfect.\nThank you!",

				"I wish I had paid Emily Su&#8217;s review more attention, because I do agree largely with what she said. While it did gel up almost perfectly (the alcoholic ones, anyway; I also made some virgin versions and they did not gel nearly as well), there was something very off about the texture of the ginger cream layer. Maybe it would have been better if I had substituted the nut milk like suggested.\nAnd while you could most definitely taste the jalepeno, you could barely taste the mango, though to be fair, I used a mango cocktail juice as I couldn&#8217;t find just plain mango juice. I considered mango nectar but chose the cocktail juice instead mostly because it was cheaper, so maybe it would have tasted better with the mango nectar. I dunno.\nNobody including myself really wanted to try more than one, and I made a LOT, so I&#8217;d say it was a pretty big failure. Im afraid that none of my friends will try any other vegan jello shots I make in the future.",

These are, by far, absolutely the most delicious Indian recipes I\u2019ve ever made &#8211; and I\u2019ve made recipes from many sources. The biryani, in particular, is incredible &#8211; better than what we\u2019ve had at many restaurants! It requires a few steps but it is so worth it for a special meal (and lots of leftovers &#8211; the best!) Thank you, Eva &#8211; I will come back to your recipes again and again!",

				"I LOVE this recipe! I started making it back in 2018 or 2019 and it&#8217;s always my go-to when I need some comfort food! The Mac n cheese has such a good flavor, is creamy &amp; doesn&#8217;t have that off vegan flavor/texture that some nut-based mac&#8217;s can have. Thank you!",
				"@Eva Agha, You emailed me the recipe a year ago, thank you for that and I see that it&#8217;s visible again on the website, too.  I finally got around to making it today and wow, I wish I had made it earlier!  I&#8217;ve made the buffalo tofu a few times for salads, and it is soo so good, but this is the first time trying the mac n cheese. I didn&#8217;t like the first couple of bites, maybe because I was expecting a cheese flavor and nothing but cheese tastes like cheese, lol (I&#8217;m not vegan, can you tell?), but once we changed the name to mac n sauce and just appreciated it for what it was, we realized it was incredibly delicious.  I went back for seconds!  I often crave mac n cheese, but dairy doesn&#8217;t sit well in my body, but this made me feel great!  And so quick and easy to make!  It is going into my recipe book for sure!  I love that it is a healthy plus animal friendly comfort food!  Yum!  Thanks!  Going to browse all your other recipes now for more gem, hehee!",
				"This was so good, wholefamily loved it!",
				"Made this tonight!! Wonderful. Thank you for the recipe",
				"This is so delicious and easy! I love the the ingredients for the Mac n cheese sauce are non perishable and can whip up in just a few minutes!  Thank you so much for sharing! Can\u2019t wait to enjoy this again!",
				"Same, right now I can only see the comments, there is not recipe visible on the page for me&#8230; :/",
				"Dang, just started pressing the tofu and&#8230;the recipe is gone??? Just comments now.",
				"I&#8217;ve been sitting on this recipe for a while and am so glad I finally tried it tonight! The buffalo tofu is amazing! I&#8217;ll be using this breading/baking method in other recipes too, it&#8217;s so good. And the mac &amp; cheese is the first vegan one I&#8217;ve made that I&#8217;ll actually make again, just as others have said. The texture is perfect, and although I don&#8217;t love that I can taste some coconut, that is easily masked with a little extra buffalo sauce ? Do you think I could skip the coconut milk next time and sub more plant milk instead, or does it need the coconut milk to thicken? Thanks for the great recipe! Shared with some vegan Facebook groups ?",
				"The buffalo part of this recipe is amazing. 100% will make that again. The cheeze sauce, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t our taste. The texture was slimy, not creamy. Sadly we had a few bites and had to toss it.  I have had much better success with cashew based cheeze sauces. Cheers.",
				"Can this be made in advance and reheated?",
				"Okay I am a meat-eater but I did used to be vegetarian. I had tried several mac n &#8220;cheese&#8221; recipes with pumpkin and/or cashew and the like but was never a fan. Now I still entertain some vegan friends and decided to give this one a go. Well let me tell you, I&#8217;ve never even made a from-scratch real mac n cheese recipe that I&#8217;ve liked as much as this one! I am not a huge smoke fan so I did use only one teaspoon of smoked paprika but this was so silky, creamy, and flavorful. It is a perfect accomplice to a backyard BBQ. The tofu was superb too. All in all, a huge hit with everyone! My only complaint is when I added the tapioca starch it thickened almost instantly and I had to whisk very fast and add water due to clumps. End result was still fantastic though! I only had about 10 oz of pasta but added all of the sauce to it anyways. There wasn&#8217;t a drop left.",
				"This recipe is fantastic!  Best vegan cheese sauce I&#8217;ve ever made and the tofu was crispy and delicious and perfect! Will definitely be making again soon!",
				"This mac and cheese was a huge hit here!. My son LOVED it! Thanks for the recipe.",
				"Dude.  This whole recipe is delicious, but you just made my day with this cheese sauce!  I&#8217;ve tried what feels like a billion (but is probably only about a dozen) recipes for cheese sauce, and this was the first one where I was like, Eureka!  We&#8217;ve got it!!  *so good*!!!  It&#8217;s the closest to a real mac and cheese sauce that I&#8217;ve come across in the vegan world, and I could just hug you.   \ud83d\ude42",
				"Mmmmm this was so, so good! I  would not have thought that mac and cheese could taste like this with coconut milk, wow.  I followed pretty much exactly but we were low on plant milk so I just filled the empty coconut milk can with some of the pasta cooking water and splashed that in instead. Worked great. Delicious with loads of freshly ground black pepper. We also loved sprinkling the top with the little bits of spicy Panko that were left at the bottom of the bowl after tossing the tofu wings in the hot sauce. Thank you!",
				"I tried only the coconut milk mac &amp; cheese part of this recipe last night, just to test it out.  It was absolutely fantastic!  My teenage boys took second helpings,which, of course, is the true measure of success!  I have tried nut based mac &amp; cheese recipes that I thought were okay, but none of them really &#8220;wowed&#8221; me &#8211; yours totally does!  I will definitely make the entire recipe next time but now I know that your recipe is absolutely going to be my &#8220;go to&#8221; recipe for macaroni and cheese!  Thank you!",
				"This looks om nom nom amazing, thank you for  sharing. I&#8217;m happy that you chose to use tofu for the wings rather than cauliflower.",
				"This recipe looks amazing! The creamy mac and cheese with the crunchy tofu wings plus that hit of spice&#8230;. I can&#8217;t wait to make (and EAT) this!",
				"Looks delicious and sounds so easy? Can you just use flour to thicken cheese sauce?"

				"3. In a mixing bowl, mash the bananas until they form a smooth paste. If they aren't overripe and remain a little chunky you might want to consider using an immersion blender to blend the bananas to a silky smooth texture, otherwise you may end up with some light colored banana chunks in the final dark chocolatey muffins. As long as the bananas are ripe, this is only a visual problem, so blending is optional.",

				"5. In a second large mixing bowl whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to combine.",
				"6. When the oven is preheated, add the wet banana mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork or wooden spoon until the mixture is mostly mixed together but lumpy with some dry spots. Add the cocoa paste and mix until combined and batter is relatively smooth. Fold in most of the chopped chocolate, reserving some to sprinkle on top of the batter.",
				"7. Fill the prepared muffin tins 2/3 of the way full, then sprinkle the reserved chopped chocolate over each muffin. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 18-20 minutes or until the muffins have pulled away from the edge of the tin (if not using a liner). You can also test with a toothpick or a cake tester, but the chocolate chunks in the batter will make it hard to tell if it's done. A tester might pull out with some melted chocolate on it, but no wet batter and only a few crumbs should cling to it when done.",
				"8. Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then pop them out and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."

They were so incredibly light and moist inside. This is now my go to recipe for keeps",

My mother is from the Bahamas, so of course I grew up with those yummy flavors and this hit the SPOT!! Tasted like home! I added about 3-4 bay leaves and a good shake of whole all spice once I added the water!

The cornstarch and soy sauce doesn&#8217;t need to be added separately to the broccoli, in fact I&#8217;d skip adding anything to the broccoli to keep the dish lighter and less salty. Next time I make this I will make the orange sauce (more OJ), sear the seitan with the cornstarch for the crispiness, lightly steam or microwave the broccoli, then throw everything together with the sauce.",

If kneading with the stand mixer, turn the dough onto the counter at the end and knead for 1 minute making any necessary adjustments at that time.",

Roll out to 1/2\" thick and cut using a doughnut cutter or a ~3 1/2\" round cutter, using a ~1 1/2\" cutter to make the center hole. Collect the scraps of dough and doughnut holes and lightly knead back together. Reroll and cut the dough into doughnuts, repeating until all the dough is cut. Place the prepared doughnuts onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, cover, and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes.",

Can your momos and dumplings be frozen? I know tofu changes its texture when it&#8217;s frozen (I&#8217;ve deliberately done that by just freezing tofu in the package, defrosting, and then squeezing out tons of water) but I didn&#8217;t know if the tofu in the momos or dumplings would make the dumplings extra watery on the inside when cooking them after being frozen? Does my question and what I&#8217;m rambling about make sense? I hope so!",

				"1. First, sanitize everything that will be touching the cheese. Rinse your blender with boiling hot water as well as a glass or ceramic mixing bowl to culture the cheese, any measuring cups, and your spatula. No metal should come in contact with the mixture after the probiotics have been added, so get a silicon spatula or wooden spoon for stirring and sanitize that as well.",
				"2. Add the cashews to the sanitized blender along with the distilled water, melted coconut oil, nutritional yeast, miso, ground mustard, and salt and blend until very smooth and creamy. Transfer the mixture to a sanitized large glass or ceramic bowl (as metal can inhibit the culturing) and empty out 6 probiotic capsules into the cashew mixture. Stir these in with a sanitized wooden or silicon spoon and cover the mixture. Let it culture at room temperature for 24-36 hours, stirring once or twice part way throughout and tasting it as it cultures. When it reaches your desired level of tangy and sourness, put the mixture in the fridge to stop the culturing process. How long the mixture takes to culture can depend on the ambient temperature of your room.",
				"3. Rub the inside of a fondue pot or a pot on the stove with the cut clove of garlic and discard the garlic. Transfer the cultured cheese into a fondue pot or into a pot on the stove. Mix the tapioca starch in the 2 tablespoons of water to create a slurry and add that to the cheese along with the white wine and the nutmeg.",
				"4. Heat the fondue pot, or heat over the stove on low heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture is hot and bubbly. The cheese sauce will become thick and stretchy as the tapioca starch activates.",

				"Thanks for the quick reply! I stopped culturing it at around 33 hours, and got that funky, kind of sour yogurtyish taste and smell (it was slightly reminiscent of that anyway). It was SO good and reminded me of when I used to get dairy fondues out at nice restaurants. I will definitely be making it again and again. Thank you so much!! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hey Eva-first of all, I love your recipes and am so grateful for them. I\u2019ve spent some time in India as my partner is from Delhi, so to be able to find better-than-restaurant indian food that is also vegan is incredible (especially because his family doesn\u2019t believe indian food can be made without ghee or other animal products, as you probably suspect). So thank you. It\u2019s so inspiring to the two of us as vegans.\nOn to my question, which might be a bit silly: how do I know if the cheese is culturing? Will it taste very different, or just a little different? I\u2019ve been culturing it in LA here for about 27 hours with the windows open about half the time (temps in the 70s &amp; 80s) and don\u2019t notice a big difference in taste, if any at all. It\u2019s definitely yummy, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s culturing.\nAny help is appreciated because I\u2019ll definitely be culturing lots of vegan cheeses from now on. \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hello. This recipe looks delicious. I love to try new recipes but am trying to avoid oil. Is there any substitution you can suggest to take it&#8217;s place? Perhaps a little extra of another of the liquid ingredients?  Thank you for sharing.",
				"Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe! My daughter is alergic t\u00f4 regular cheese  and  dairys.  I will try this for her!",
				"Hi Eva,\nthank you for replying back so quickly. Your suggestion to substitute the wine sounds perfect!\nI&#8217;ll let you know how it turned out when I make it.\nthank you!\nSusana",
				"Wow, so impressed with this recipe reading through it &#8211; I&#8221;m super excited to test this out! The cheese sounds absolutely magnificent, and you&#8217;ve officially inspired me to start culturing my own cheeses going forward!\nSunny XO",
				"Hi Eva\nIt&#8217;s Susana from Canada. I just adore all of your recipes; I look forward to each and every one of them with anticipation.\nI am so excited to try this fondue!! It is so authentic with the creative way of making it a &#8220;cultured cheese&#8221;. I like this version so much more than the other versions; I can see the flavor profile being so good with all the additional ingredients.\nI had one question:  can I substitute something for the alcohol? I.e. adding a little broth plus something a little acidic (i.e. a vinegar?)\nI love that you have so many &#8220;cheese&#8221; recipes on the blog, which are creative. The quejo fresco is amazing.\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make more cultured cheeses!  That is one of my passions is to make dairy free substitutes (as close as possible to the real thing)\nThank you for all of the amazing hard work you do, in the very detailed steps that you give us so that our recipes are successful.\nThank you for giving us recipes that are more detailed  (which are not boring!), which I love (i.e. bread making, cake building, papusas, Indian food). I could go on and on, I love all the recipes that you put out\nThank you for your kindness\nSusana"

			"serving": "1 cake",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF and prepare your baking pan(s) by spraying them with oil, then placing a circle of parchment paper to cover the bottom.",
				"2. In a small mixing bowl combine the apple cider vinegar and plant milk and set aside for at least 5 minutes.",
				"3. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, hazelnut meal, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda until well combined.",
				"4. Mix the oil, hazelnut liqueur, and vanilla extract into the clabbered milk, then add the wet ingredients to the dry. Whisk to combine and until the mixture is smooth (minus any larger grinds of hazelnut meal).",
				"5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan (or divide in half if baking 2 cakes). Bake the 8\" cakes for 35-37 minutes, bake the 6\" cakes for 27-29 minutes. The cakes are done when the edges are golden and have pulled away from the sides of the pan and a test comes out clean or with one or two crumbs.",
				"6. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Then working gently set a wire cooling rack over the pan and turn the pan upside down to release the cake--shake or tap gently to help release if necessary. Remove the pan, then peel off the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake before turning the cake back upright on a cooling rack. Allow the cake fully cool.",
				"7. Place the cooled cakes on a cardboard cake board and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in the fridge or in freezer-safe ziplock bags in the freezer until ready to decorate. Decorate cakes when cold for best results!",
				"8. Place the finely chopped dark chocolate in a heat safe mixing bowl.",
				"9. In a small pot heat the coconut milk, sugar, and salt until it comes to a low simmer. Stir occasionally to dissolve the sugar.",
				"10. When simmering, pour over the chopped chocolate and rotate the bowl to submerge the chocolate. Cover and let sit for 4-5 minutes.",
				"11. Add the hazelnut liqueur, then whisk the mixture until smooth. Allow to cool about 30 minutes at room temperature, then cover and place in the fridge--place plastic wrap to touch the top of the ganache to prevent it from forming a skin. Allow to thoroughly chill, at least 4 hours but ideally overnight.",
				"12. When ready to whip the chocolate will be thick, very firm, and can be scooped with a spoon. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl and whip the ganache until light and fluffy. This will take 2-5 minutes depending on your machine! Use immediately to decorate your cakes. If the ganache gets too runny it probably wasn't chilled enough and put it back in the fridge until ready."

				"I rarely comment, but I had to for this one! I scaled the 8&#8243; recipe up 1.7X and baked it in a 12-cup bundt pan. Topped with a dark chocolate ganache and roasted hazelnut meal, this cake was a dream: super moist, hazelnutty and all around delicious!\nFirst, thanks for publishing weights for your recipes. It makes scaling up and down super easy. Secondly, thanks for this wonderful recipe itself!",
				"I planned to make my hazelnut meringue tower for Christmas but something went wrong so I had to improvise. I wanted a cake with hazelnuts and when I saw you had a recipe I went for it! I was very confident it would be awesome, because I made your vanille layer cake a while back and it was amazing as well.\nI filled it with a chocolate mousse and used a hazelnut buttercream as a topping. All vegan of course. I made two 8&#8243; cakes. Next time I will cut off the domes as the cake layers were a bit too high.\nThanks for another great recipe!",
				"Hi, I\u2019m planning on using this recipe to make cupcakes but I\u2019m not sure which measurement to use (6 inch or 8 inch). Which measurement do you think will give 12 cupcakes?",
				"I\u2019ve been looking for a cake that looks similar and hope tastes similar to my wedding cake. This cake looks almost like my wedding cake except the outside of my cake was white not chocolate. And I don\u2019t know if it was vegan. Will this work to make this cake non-vegan ?",
				"Can add just add .5 to 1 cup of cocoa powder to the cake mixture to make this a chocolate hazelnut cake?",
				"how much almond extract and vanilla would you recommend to turn this into an almond flavored cake? thanks for sharing!",
				"Hi there! Just to let you know I did freeze the cupcakes for about a week and placed them in a Tupperware container. They turned out just as delicious as the cake!! Thanks again!",
				"Thank you for the tip! Following your advice, I ended up replacing the coconut milk with about 200g of Ripple half and half, which is the thickest plant based creamer I can find out there that has a fairly neutral taste. I think it worked out quite nicely! I let it sit in the fridge for about 5 hours before whipping it, so it was a tad runny half way through frosting the cake. I think it probably would be fine if I let it set in the fridge overnight. Overall, I think the ganache turned out really well! This recipe is most definitely a keeper! Thank you again!",
				"Can coconut milk be substituted? I&#8217;m concerned that the frosting will taste a little too coconuty. By the way your cake recipe is AMAZING!!!!!!! I tried your vanilla cake recipe and this is literally THE best vegan cake recipe period. I can&#8217;t wait to try the chocolate cake one!",
				"Thanks so much! ?",
				"I made this cake back in February for my kids birthday and it was the best vegan cake I\u2019ve ever tasted! I am now wondering about freezing this recipe in the form of cupcakes. Will they dry out or should they be okay to freeze?",
				"Hi Eva, is it ok to replace hazelnut with almond meal? If so, should I replace it with same amount?",
				"I made this for National Hazelnut Cake Day on June 1,but in the form of cupcakes,so it was easier for my co-workers to sample. It was a great success!",
				"The only thing I\u2019ve made from scratch that didn\u2019t come out disgusting is a cheesecake and now this cake! I Just made this cake and it was very easy to make. The yellow cake is delicious and the ganache is sooo rich and yummy! I put the ganache in the freezer for about 45 minutes because I\u2019m just that impatient and  luckily it was not runny when I applied it to the cake. Amazing recipe thank you so much for sharing!",
				"Just made this cake  and it was fabulous,  moist and nutty.\nWould definitely make again.  Made it with an earl grey lavender buttercream topped  with blackberries.  Yumm\nThanks for sharing this dilicious vegan cake recipe.",

				"I made the loaf once and must have done something wrong when preparing the seitan as it crumbled to bits in the oven which also caused the risotto to dry out. Second time, it came out wonderfully. I prepared it with the roasted root vegetables because it looked so good and just seemed so right, after all, it is mid November. The only thing I did outside of the recipe is I added a bit of parmesan and good portion of chanterelles to the risotto as I live in the Pacific NW and have my secret spot I go to every year to pick said mushrooms. The secret spot kept on giving until just this last week, longer than usual, so you can understand why I couldn&#8217;t resist using the fruits of my foraging.\nAwesome recipe! Thank you.",

Dust the parchment paper and the dough with flour and gently hit the dough with rolling pin to flatten it out and soften it a little to prevent cracking as you roll. Roll away from you and rotate the pie dough with each roll about 1/6\" of a turn so that the dough is rolled out evenly and in a circle.

Cut the fats into the flour until you have a well combined mixture. It should be pebbly and starting to clump together.",
				"2. Add the last cup (132g) of flour and briefly cut into the dough to combine. Pour in 4 tbsp (60g) of ice cold water and use a wooden spoon or silicon spatula to combine and gently knead/press the dough together. If there are any dry crumbs left on the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle in the additional cold water, a tablespoon or so at a time until it's able to form a dough. Do not make a smooth dough at this point, you can leave it a bit crumbly.",
				"3. Using your hands press the dough together and cut in half. Wrap each half in plastic wrap and form a 1\" thick disk. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours to chill before rolling out. You can refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze for longer storage, defrosting in the refrigerator before use."

				"Hi Eva, thanks for the outstanding recipe! I even didn&#8217;t have time to do the slow, blind baking method that you referred to by Stella Parks. I actually made the dough just like you instructed but then I quickly rolled it out and refrigerated it for 1.5 hours (all I had time for!). I had to blind bake it at 400 for 20 minutes instead of 350 for an hour. It still turned out really delicious! I used Miyoko&#8217;s salted stick butter. This will be my go to quiche dough recipe from now on but next time I&#8217;ll do it just like you said!",
				"I plan on making a berry pie. I was wondering if I should pre-bake the crust before I put in the berry mixture or bake it all at once? \nThanks",
				"Outstanding recipe and I love the blog instructions.  So clear, so helpful.  This is the best vegan crust I&#8217;ve ever made.  I think using Miyoko&#8217;s cultured vegan butter made quite a difference in taste.  I needed more water than the 4-6 tbps., but my dough came together beautifully with the extra water and rolled out like a dream.  I made an apple pie with a lattice crust.\n I&#8217;ve never seen so many layers!!   Incredibly flakey and delicious!  I also used the weight measures you listed in the recipe as I find my baking is just better measuring that way.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful vegan pie crust recipe.  I hope others try it.  THE BEST!!",
				"Hi, is it possible to write using grams and/or teaspoons/tablespoons?\nWhat is a cup of something? My cups are half a litre, is that ok? What is a stick of butter? I have never in my life seen a stick of butter.\nI wish I could use this recipe as it looks delicious, but I can&#8217;t work out the weights.",
				"I finally made this pie dough and it is amazing. I don\u2019t know why I waited so long.  Nerves I guess!\nSo flaky and light yet still tastes buttery. Loads better than the all-butter pastry I made in my pregan days, which I had thought was pretty good at the time! Thank you!",
				"I have been looking for a vegan pastry recipe since becoming vegan 4 years ago.  The search is over.  AMAZING!!",
				"Hi! Could one use a food processor instead of a handheld pastry blender? Thanks \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi!\nEager to try this dough. Just wondering if you yourself use weights or cups when you make your recipes. I prefer to follow whatever method the author herself used (and I calculate 2.5 cups of flour as 300g, so I\u2019m confused\u2026). Thanks!"

				"Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I made it today for the first time and it came out perfectly! Beautifully spiced (I\u2019m working on increasing my baby mouth spice tolerance) \ud83e\udd23. I used two jalape\u00f1os with about half the seeds left in and served with brown basmati rice that I cooked in my instant pot. \nI am just learning how to make traditional Indian dishes and I love dal makhani. I stopped eating dairy and cannot order it as takeout anymore since restaurants use dairy in the recipe. Thank you so much for teaching me how to make a dairy free version for myself.",
				"@Joker, hahaha! This comment was great!",
				"I love your recipes.Can I replace the tomatoes ?",
				"So delicious, thank you! I used brown lentils and black beans, which were very tasty. My blunder was using low fat coconut milk, so I had to add sugar to the dish to  balance it. Would not recommend using low fat coconut milk, go for the real deal",

				"My story&#8230;I had this dish for the first time last week at an Indian restaurant vegan and all. Came home to find a recipe and the one I made was completely flavorless so I found yours and while I did not make it as written I used many components to improve the other one and it did help. Next time I will prepare yours as written except substituting deggi mirch for the optional cayenne as I now have a plentiful supply.\nTwo questions for you though&#8230;what type of chile? There are so many and I am not a fan of HOT. Also I plan to freeze at least half of the recipe so am wondering if I still add the coconut cream at the end and prior to freezing or add when I am heating to serve.\nThank you in advance for your expert advise!",
				"I made the vegan Dal makhani! My daughter who is a good cook herself and quite critical- loved it! This says All!\nThank you so much for saving me \ud83d\ude0d",
				"Let me start by saying,  that I&#8217;ve never  eaten this dish  before I made this recipe.  I stumbled across it, and it sounded interesting.  Both my husband and myself absolutely loved it. I was surprised my local Co op had the black gram. We live in a very small and remote area. I was super happy we found it. I made mine in a insta pot and used dried kidney beans, also cooked in the insta. Also I used homemade gram masala,  and Ancho chilies, we don&#8217;t care for a ton of heat. This is a recipe we will definitely make often. I had to stop myself at the third bowl, it&#8217;s that good.  Thank you for the recipe and enabling us to broaden our palate!!",
				"Thank you.that was a nice dish",
				"This is the BEST homemade Indian dish I have made. Love it, I already have extra in the freezer. I used whole chopped jalape\u00f1os with the small amount of cayenne called for and the heat level was perfect",
				"Hi. I\u2019ve made this several times and my daal always comes out hard. The last time, I ended up with too little water after the first simmer. Now I lowered the temp compared to last time and they\u2019re super hard. I can\u2019t find the happy medium.",
				"Hi Jessi, urad dal are a type of lentil, if that&#8217;s what caused the confusion maybe?",
				"Hi there! This dish looks amazing! I do have a question. I can\u2019t seem to find anything about the amount of lentils. How many lentils does this recipe call for?  And, what type do you recommend? \nThanks so much!!! We can\u2019t wait to try it for my husband\u2019s birthday a week from today!",
				"What type of chili pepper do you use? Are they dried?",
				"I loved this recipe, it has become one of our household favourites!\nThank you ?",
				"This was absolutely delicious!!!  We are not vegan and used a lactose-free plain yogurt to finish it but the whole family was impressed with the rich and complex flavours.  Looking forward to heating up the leftovers for our lunches tomorrow.  \nThanks so much for the great recipes, beautiful photos, and informative descriptions.   We can&#8217;t wait to try some of your other recipes.",

				"Thanks for the post! I couldn&#8217;t believe I found everything in this fantastic and thankfully vegan recipe in my local market in a small town in Oregon. I&#8217;ve had the cream-rich dish in India and I was super worried that what I was concocting wouldn&#8217;t live up to the big dairy fullness that I treasured&#8230;but low and behold it did! Yay, thanks. Oh, and I cooked the beans about an hour instead of the 30-40 mins because I wanted them more them a little squishier. \ud83d\ude42 mmmmm",
				"I followed the directions and kept all the original ingredients and it was amazing so yummy thank you for this recipe! Next time I will double the recipe. How long will this last for in the fridge ?",
				"I meant to say great flavor and texture. \nPS the &#8220;eat over medium&#8221; part also have me a chuckle. No worries&#8230; I once wrote a property description stating the &#8220;house came with 2 panties&#8221; instead of  2 pantries&#8221;.",
				"This is a wonderful recipe with a great. We recently moved and I could only find my ground spices and not my whole ones. \nI added the ground spices after the onions, garlic and fresh ground ginger;  the fragrance was heavenly. I also used petite, diced tomatoes and used the liquid to thin the stew after everything was combined. \nI have an insulated metal thermos and will be taking this stew, rice, and chopped cilantro for my work lunch. Yummy!!!??",
				"Looks really good, but would it be okay to use fenugreek powder in place of dried fenugreek leaves or would that change the flavor too much?",
				"Can you use tomato paste instead of puree?",
				"Would there be any reason you couldn&#8217;t use pinto beans or pinquito beans? I do not like kidney beans.",
				"&#8220;In a large pot eat the coconut oil or vegan butter over medium&#8221;\nThis was the most difficult part of the recipe for me. It took me ages to find a medium willing to come to my kitchen and sit on the floor while I ate coconut oil above her. \ud83d\ude42\nSeriously though. Thank you so much for the recipe &#8211; great to experience dal makhani again (after having gone vegan).",
				"This is so good! I cheated and used pre-steamed lentils. I am glad there was comments about tomato paste and puree. I used the puree, as intended. I skipped the chiles (I was making it for my kids) and kasoori methi (I didn&#8217;t have it on hand). The flavor is excellent and this was not difficult to make. I have made dahl makni before and used so much butter (I am not vegan). This version was better. I will definitely make this again.",
				"Just made it and loved it! The blend of spices and peppers are so aromatic. It will leave our house smelling wonderfully for hours! Good recipe!",
				"hi! can i make this with urad split dal?",
				"I&#8217;m not sure if I did something wrong in the recipe, I added the water used to cook the urad dal and it turned out more grey compared to the redder colour of the curry in the pictures&#8230;should I maybe just use water instead next time?",
				"We absolutely love this recipe! We added the ground spices later to avoid burning (this included ground cumin in our case) as per your suggestion. It is a gorgeous recipe &#8211; smell, taste and texture. We will be coming back to your site for more vegan delights!",
				"Omg! I am in love with this recipe ? thank you.",
				"I have been looking for a vegan recipe that would emulate what I get at my favourite Indian restaurant.  I tried this recipe and it was to die for!!\nI added diced tofu in it as I needed to use it and made enough to last 2 days.\nI will definitely be trying this recipe again.",
				"This is a fantastic recipe, I loved it as did my whole family.Thank you and keep them coming, you are an inspiration.",
				"I used diced fire roasted tomatoes&#8230;.maybe not what was meant. It&#8217;s a bit watery. I&#8217;ll continue to simmer.",
				"My first time on this site, my first recipe and I give it FIVE stars!  This recipe is addictive \ud83d\ude42\nI used green small lentils and for a chili, I used a Jalapeno chopped up and took out perhaps about 70% of the seeds. It ended up perfectly spicy. I used the 1 cup of tomato paste the recipe called for but was skeptic to that amount. After simmering for 5 minutes with spices it was still VERY much tomato flavor only.\nBut&#8230; no need to fear. After finishing the recipe there is a complex flavor of spices, almost hard to separate the flavors in the stew, with a creaminess indeed. The flavor is addictive and I will definitely make this recipe many many times again!\nThank you! I am very impressed with how you create such a depth in this dish. I can&#8217;t wait to try more of your recipes!!!",
				"Hi Eva. Greetings from NZ. I am so loving your recipes &#8211; they are amazing &#8211; flavoursome, easy and inexpensive to make and they are full of fabulous, easy to find, mouthwatering ingredients.  The urad dahl  is soaking at the moment and mid afternoon I&#8217;ll be getting started on making this dish for the first time.  One of the many great things about living by myself is that these recipes provide enough food for several meals and I can freeze at least half so I am never short of something nutritious for dinner when I don&#8217;t feel like cooking a full meal from scratch."

Place a rack one third of the way down from the top of the oven, and place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack.

Spread the garlic white sauce over the dough then top with the caramelized mushroom mixture, vegan mozzarella, and the fresh rosemary.",
				"6. Transfer the pizza onto the baking steel or pizza stone and bake for about 8 minutes. If needed, turn the heat to broil for another 1-2 minutes to brown the top. Alternatively, bake on a baking sheet:\u00a0assemble the pizza straight on the pan and place directly in the oven to bake.",

Even went all out and bought a stone and peel! I did adjust that a bit &#8211; 1.5 cups whole wheat, 1.5 cups all purpose, and 1 cup spelt.  Turned out great but made enough for about 2 pizzas. Thank you so much!",
				"Could this be made with Lavish Flatbread instead of pizza dough?  I was thinking about trying that and just wondering if anyone has tried that before?",
				"This pizza is amazing!  I will definitely be making this again soon (especially since my non-vegan family preferred this to their own).  You know it\u2019s delicious when a 5 year old asks for seconds and thirds!",
				"Yum, Yum, yum!  This was so good!  I added some white truffle oil when it came out of the oven.  It was so good",

I made a family recipe for bolognese that was very similar to this, except of course that it was traditional. This has all the flavor and joy of my family recipe, without the unhealthy aspects.

				"Fantastic. A absolutel favourite!!",

I used dried herbs because that&#8217;s what I had on hand, and it still packed a lot of flavor with shaved vegan parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Fortunately, the recipe makes a generous amount of sauce, so we have plenty to enjoy again tomorrow."

				"I just want to thank you for such a delicious vegan cake!! I baked it last evening for my Mom\u2019s 86th birthday today. We have been vegan since Jan 2021. Honestly, it rivals any non-vegan cake by far. Even my carnivore Dad ate two slices and wanted some to take home. I followed your recipe for two 6-inch cakes and they came out perfectly and so moist! Your instructions and video were clear and easy to follow. \nThank you again!!",

My oven takes 40min (!!) for 2x 6inch cakes to come out perfect which is a lot longer baking time. But ovens can be so so variable. The one time I pulled them out going by the time (my first bake) they collapsed as they weren\u2019t cooked enough.",

I am gonna make it next week as a big wedding cake for a friend, and was wondering if I could make all the mix at one time and leave a part of it aside while each part is in the oven, or is it better to make each layer mix apart so that it wont affect the texture?",

This was a practice cake, so I can try again (making a cake for my son&#8217;s first birthday). I did use 9 inch pans. So maybe I needed to bake the cakes for longer.

				"Just made this.  Beautiful, luscious cake!  The flavor is great, it is moist, beautiful color.  Everyone loved it.  Your instructions were clear (I read thru everything) and resulted in this great success.  Thank you!",
				"Hi I want to make this cake for my friends birthday, what would you suggest for a gluten free alternative?",
				"Have you ever experimented with this recipe as a base for a lemon scented cake? I am wondering about the amount of lemon juice and zest for a one-layer 8&#8243; cake. Thanks"

				"1. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the whole wheat flour, potato flour, salt, and instant yeast (see note if using active dry yeast). Add the coconut oil and rub into the flour with your hands until you have a sandy texture, some small clumps are okay. Add the warm non-dairy milk and maple syrup and mix with a wooden spoon until combined.",
				"2. If kneading by hand: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 3 minutes. Add a dusting of flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking too much to the counter or your hands. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Then, knead an additional 4 minutes until you have a tacky but smooth dough (note: whole wheat dough does not get as smooth as your white flour doughs). ",

Mix again for 3 minutes with the dough hook on low speed, then turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and knead by hand for 1 minute. Make any last adjustments with flour to get a supple but tacky dough.",
				"4. Drizzle some oil into a large bowl and turn the ball of dough around in the oil to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to approximately double in size, about 1 1/2-2 hours.",
				"5. Divide the dough into 16 pieces and shape into balls. Cup your hands around the ball of dough resting your fingers and heel of your hand on the counter and roll it around to create a taught skin and seal the bottom seam. Place the shaped rolls in an oiled baking pan (they will not touch)--use 2 8 or 9\" round pans or square pans or a 9x13\" rectangular pan. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until doubled in size.",
				"6. About 30-45 minutes before you're ready to bake, turn the oven to preheat to 375 \u00baF. Brush the rolls with plant milk and sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional) before putting in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes until darker and golden on top. Let cool 3-5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack, and brush with melted vegan butter if desired for an extra buttery tasting roll."

I&#8217;m not vegan or even vegetarian,  but I am always on the hunt for healthier versions or things. I would gladly choose this dip over any other. No matter your diet (or lack of diet), I highly recommend this dip. You could easily trick somebody into thinking this thing is 1000 calories per fork full.",

Also didn\u2019t have the thyme or oregano, so I ended up subbing some other spices. I\u2019m sure it would have been super amazing with the correct spices.

Add more flour to the counter under the dough and sprinkle more flour on top as needed to prevent sticking, and roll the dough out once more until 1/2\" thick. Fold in half, and then half again.

I used the vegan liquid mozzarella so I had to drop the temp to 525 so it wouldn\u2019t burn but it was still perfect. Best pizza I\u2019ve had since going vegan. The pizza gods and my tummy thank you so much for this!",

If making the zucchini bowls, slice off the top of the zucchini and using a small teaspoon scoop out the inside flesh then chop it up, you should end up with at least 1 1/2 cups of squash, 2 or 2 1/2 cups is fine too. If using long thin zucchini, slice in half lengthwise and hollow each half out like a canoe. Set aside.",

				"3 oz dark chocolate, chopped",
				"3 oz (generous 1/3 cup) coconut cream (skimmed from the top of a can of coconut milk)",
				"1/4 cup light corn syrup",
				"pinch of salt"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 42 minutes",
			"serving": "~10 cups frosting",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Place the strawberries and sugar in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat down to low and let simmer for about 10-12 minutes until thickened and syrupy. Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the sauce so it is smooth, pressing out the remaining pulp to extract the juice. You should end up with about 1 cup of strawberry sauce. Allow to fully cool and chill in the fridge.",
				"2. Whisk together the water and sugar in a small saucepan. Turn the heat on low and cover until the sugar is dissolved.",
				"3. Meanwhile add the reduced and cold aquafaba to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the cream of tartar. Whisk by hand with the whisk attachment until slightly frothy, then hook up and turn the mixer on a medium speed.",
				"4. Back to the sugar syrup, remove the lid (using the lid helps any sugar crystals on the side of the pot dissolve into the mixture) and set up a candy thermometer so it isn't touching the bottom of the pot. Watch the temperature carefully until it gets to 234 \u00baF (112 \u00baC) then turn up the stand mixer to high so that the aquafaba forms stiff peaks. You can turn up the heat to medium if you are careful and keep a close eye on the temperature.",
				"5. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches 248 \u00baF (120 \u00baC) it's ready to be added to the aquafaba meringue. At this point the meringue should have formed stiff peaks, which means that the meringue that clings to the whisk when removed will stay in a thin upright peak when inverted. If you invert the whole bowl over your head it shouldn't slide or budge a centimeter.",
				"6. When the syrup is at the edge of the firm and hard ball stages at 248 \u00baF and the meringue has reached stiff peaks, keep your mixer on high and slowly drizzle in the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to aim between the whisk and the edge of the bowl to keep the sugar syrup from splattering. Be careful as the sugar syrup is VERY hot. Pour the entire syrup into the meringue. The meringue will increase in size as the syrup is added.",
				"7. When all the syrup is added switch to a paddle attachment and turn it on to high. Let the mixture beat until it has fully cooled down. It should feel cool to the touch. You can speed up this process by placing an ice pack underneath the bowl if the shape of your mixer allows.",
				"8. Do not add the fat before the meringue has COMPLETELY cooled down. Once cool, leave the mixer at a high speed and very slowly add in the fat, just a spoonful at a time, letting it incorporate before adding the next spoon. If you do this slowly and all your ingredients are cold everything should work out fine (note: it's normal to lose volume when you add fat, but it thickens up as more fat is added). However, it can happen that the mixture breaks and looks curdled. Do not give up, keep adding the fat and it should come back together. It may need to be chilled if it doesn't come back together after adding the fat, so stick everything (bowl and paddle attachment) into the fridge to chill for several minutes before trying again.",
				"9. When your buttercream is thick and fluffy and all the fat has been added, turn the speed of the mixer down to medium and while running add in the vanilla extract. Then, with the mixer still running, slowly pour in the strawberry sauce. Start with 3/4 cups of sauce and add more to taste and desired color is reached.",
				"10. At this point the buttercream can be used to frost a cake. If you want the frosting to firm up a little before decorating place in the fridge to chill and firm checking every several minutes. Once it's chilled sufficiently take it out and use to frost chilled cakes.",
				"11. If you want to make the buttercream in advance, you can refrigerate or freeze the frosting before the strawberry sauce is added. Bring the frosting to room temperature and re-fluff with the paddle attachment, then add the strawberry sauce and use immediately.",
				"12. See the post for details on decorating.",
				"13. Add the chopped chocolate to a heat proof bowl. Bring the coconut cream to a simmer over medium heat, then pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk from the center out until completely melted and smooth. Add the corn syrup and a pinch of salt and mix just to combine.",
				"14. Let the chocolate sauce cool until it runs easily and thickly off of a spoon, then pour the chocolate sauce into drips along the edge of the frosted and chilled cake using a spoon. Once you've made all your dips pour additional sauce to cover the top of the cake, spreading using an offset spatula and gently tipping the cake. To make a spiral design: let chocolate cool slightly and firm up, then place the tip of the spatula in the center of the cake and spin the cake slowly around while letting the spatula slide outwards as it rotates.",
				"15. Cut the cake when chilled for cleanest cuts, but serve at or close to room temperature for the best textures."

				"This is such a good recipe!!! Thank you so much! I love baking and despite being vegan for 5 years now, at the beginning I didn&#8217;t know how to bake vegan, so I just baked for the others and felt bad for the animals, because its a bit ironic for me being vegan but then serving others animal products. The first time I made it was for my workplace and everyone loved it (it looked great, too!). Then I made it a few of times for family, etc. And everyone absolutely loved it. Most people doubt that a vegan cake can taste good before they taste it but once they do, they cannot stop eating it. Thank you so much!",
				"Thanks for the amazing recipe! I did it without the strawberries (as per your easy vanilla cake) and I found it perfect as buttercream to cover a 3 layer cake. It was very soft at the beginning, but after some minutes in the fridge it was perfect to frost and cover the cake. However, I put it overnight in the fridge and its consistency got too hard (even after having left it long out of the fridge before tasting it). I will definitely keep it as a buttercream recipe, but do you have any other suggestion for a softer frosting that would work OK for a 3 layer cake? I need to prepare my sister&#8217;s wedding cake and I&#8217;ve been trying several recipes but with no success. She would like a vegan 2 tier cake (3 layer each tier).",
				"To be honest, I had the same frosting journey and I hear you 100%! Can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe today, thank you for all the love and care you put into your postings!",
				"(it&#8217;s worth noting as well, that I am following the suggestion from your vegan vanilla cake recipe to omit the strawberry sauce)",
				"Hi, I just made this recipe on a trial run for using it to make a birthday cake for my vegan friend. The general consensus among the people who tried it is that its very greasy, and sort of just tastes like crisco, and it was very runny. I wanted to confirm I understood the recipe, it calls for 24oz fat total: 16oz vegan shortening (crisco in my case) and 8oz vegan butter (sunflower butter in my case). Have you run into either of those issues, and do you have any recommendations for fixing them if you have? Thanks so much! Even with the issues I had with the frosting the cake as a whole was a big hit",
				"Can you freeze this recipe? And then thaw and ice the cake at a later time?",
				"I&#8217;m no genius baker; I make everything by following recipes. I&#8217;ve had success with making baked goods, but  this is the best cake I have ever made, and the easiest. I couldn&#8217;t find chocolate extract locally nor could I procure it online in time (the linked chocolate extract in the recipe is no longer available), but I was able to get Droste cocoa and the cake was fabulously, exotically chocolatey. This recipe yielded enough batter for two 6&#8243; layers. I lacked the bandwidth and thermometer for the Italian meringue, so I made American strawberry vegan buttercream frosting and decorated with sliced strawberries and chopped walnuts. Fellow amateurs, be not afraid. You got this. Divine.",
				"I was impressed with this recipe because even though it was a bit complicated, it turned out perfectly the first time and I\u2019m a novice baker. It\u2019s very helpful to have each step laid out so explicitly. Without the strawberry, I have to say the frosting is quite bland. But a gorgeous texture. I used freeze dried strawberries instead of pur\u00e9e and it was delicious. Everyone was impressed how creamy it was. I definitely recommend adding salt if your aquafaba is unsalted.",
				"Hi, We made the meringue buttercream, but cut the recipe down to a fourth, which meant we only used 6oz of shortening.  Everything went well, and the texture is gorgeous, but it tastes like shortening.  It&#8217;s a little sweet and strawberryish, but the  overwhelming taste is shortening?  Any ideas what we did wrong?  Thank you!",
				"Hi,\nI made this will Cisco shortening and Pure soya butter. I also burnt the sugar slightly. The taste was soso (obviously from the burnt sugar) but I also noticed a &#8220;woody&#8221; aftertaste which on day 2 disappeared if that makes sense. Do you know why? The texture and sweetness were perfect tho! So I&#8217;d like to attempt this recipe again!\nThanks,\nGloria",
				"What can I use in replacement of Aquafaba?",
				"Hi!\nI\u2019ve tried your vegan vanilla cake and it was sincerely the best vegan cake I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m trying to make your cake but with raspberry in the \u201cin between\u201d layer along with your Swiss aquafaba buttercream. Would it hold better if I use raspberries instead of the strawberries in this recipe or for whatever reasons raspberries wouldn\u2019t come out the same as strawberries? Would it just be better to make separate layers (one layer buttercream, one layer raspberry jam?)\nThanks!",
				"Hi Eva!\nI would love to make a chocolate Italian meringue buttercream. I was thinking of making a cocoa powder and water mixture and adding instead of the strawberry. Do you think this will work? Thank you! So excited for this recipe \ud83d\ude42",

				"These were delicious. I didn&#8217;t have coconut oil so made them with vegan butter instead and they were still good. I used fewer chocolate chips to make them less sweet and half a teaspoon of salt in the dough. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"@thecuriouschickpea, I just made these also,and baked one sample cookie so far after chilling dough in the fridge for hours and these spread out lots leaving edges burnt and cookie not firm&#8230;had to eat it on a plate with a spoon. delicious, but would love to know what I can do to the remaining dough balls ready to be baked tomorrow. much appreciated!",
				"What are the nutrition facts for these?",
				"Delicious! I subbed the coconut oil with some leftover pulp from my oat milk to cut down on fat/oil. These are so yummy. thank you for this awesome recipe!",
				"My colleague partner made this and brought them to work and they were so delicious&#8230; I asked her for the recipe. I then made them at home and they are hit! Making another batch tonight. Super easy simple to make and my go-to cookies to make when I visit friends and such!",
				"This is such a reliable recipe &#8211; I brought them to work and two people have asked for the recipe. What I particularly love is how flexible these cookies are. I&#8217;ve made them 3 times now and each time have had to stray slightly because I didn&#8217;t have all the correct ingredients, or used slightly different cooking times, or even had to hand-whip the wet ingredients in absence of an electric mixer: on every occasion they&#8217;ve still turned out YUM. I&#8217;ve also been melting my (stiff) tahini in a pot, which creates a nice smooth consistency and adds a slightly more roasted-nut flavour.",
				"Best cookies ever!  Crispy edges and soft and gooey in the Center. Thank you!",
				"Love the flavor, but mine turned out quite hard and crumbly. Hard to bite into after storing for several days. I&#8217;m hoping this was just as simple as baking them too long. Going to try again this weekend and keep a closer eye on the bake time!",
				"Made these today AND I CANNOT STOP EATING THEM!! Followed the recipe to the T and they were perfect.",
				"mine turned out too soft and cakey&#8230;\n I like a heavier chewy cookie.",
				"i made these but gluten free; i used rice flour and some tapioca and a bit more corn starch ! i also used maple syrup so i upped the flour content a little.\nthey turned out really good !!!! i made my gluten eating bf ur pb choc oat cookies which also turned out very well and the reason i made these",
				"Just made these and they turned out amazing! Awesome recipe! Didn\u2019t have granulated sugar, so used all brown sugar. Also, I used a flavored chocolate coconut tahini which worked surprisingly well. I also substituted flour for the cornstarch, but didn\u2019t seem to make a difference. Loved the chopped dark chocolate bits, we will definitely be making again! Texture turned out great too!!",
				"There turned out absolutely Devine. I usually get them at a local bakery, but now I can make them and they taste identical!",
				"I made these with some modifications; I used Himalayan Pink Salt instead of sea salt and extra dark chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate. It was far more delicious than regular chocolate chip cookies.",
				"Hey Lois!\nI made them with Bob&#8217;s Red Mill 1 to 1 and they turned out perfectly. Maybe they spread a little bit less than Eva&#8217;s but I find this is always the case with gf cookies.",
				"i love these soooo much i just wish they weren\u2019t so oily and fragile!\nhow to accomplish this? less coconut oil?",
				"Since quarantine I\u2019ve made these 4 times- 3 times with the intent of mailing them as care packages except my S.O. (who is a chef btw) and I keep eating them lol!! Last night I made them again with oat milk (instead of almond), coconut milk that had begun to liquify a bit, and a different non-organic tahini and one of those 3 things (or perhaps all) made them a little oilier than normal but still extremely delicious. So happy to have stumbled across your blog! Making my way through your Indian recipes, too, and they are great!",
				"Thanks!  These were my questions and I just read this post.",
				"Can I use home made oat flour instead of all purpose flour?",
				"These cookies are aptly named! I discovered Tahini chocolate chip cookies through a recipe from a pretty popular American recipe blogger in Paris. I had my doubts but was quickly a member of team tahini cookies! When I became a vegan 11 months ago, I never dreamt I could have such a decadent treat again! You put me on the path of dreams come true! I did manage to throw in some oats, after which I added a splash more of almond milk. May I suggest people play around with the type of chocolate bars they choose for the recipe? I had a coffee flavored one and one with nibs and the coffee was just the right amount, though I didn&#8217;t fancy it as a candy bar, though it was from a gift pack of vegan chocolate bars. Finally, I&#8217;m in dreamland again! Thank you!",
				"Hi any idea a sub for corn starch in this particular recipe since don\u2019t have tapioca, arrowroot or potato starch. I am out of starches.",
				"i\u2019ve just made them with 1:1 gluten free flour and they\u2019re incredible!",
				"Made a quarantine \u201cuse what you have\u201d edition of these with walnut oil in place of the coconut oil and an extra TBSP of flour and they turned out so well (I did refrigerate the dough longer to be safe). No extra spread at all. If we\u2019d had any chopped walnuts I\u2019d have added those too. Hurray for flexible, foolproof recipes!\n???",
				"Love these! They turned out great the last few times I\u2019ve made them. I want to experiment with a different nut/seed butter to replace the tahini. Do you think they would still turn out?",
				"Do you use a vegan chocolate bar? If so where can I get it?",
				"Hi, i live in a tropical climate and unfortunately will not be able to have coconut oil in scoopable texture &#8211; it&#8217;s either liquid or solid (after chilling in fridge). I would really love to try your recipe, what do you suggest I do about the coconut oil?",
				"These are delicious! I made them with Crisco instead of coconut oil, Krinos brand tahini, and Elmhurst hazelnut milk.",
				"Hi.\nI read this recipe and look forward to making\nAlso read the comments\nThere is no egg substitute listed in the ingredients which may be the cause of the crumbly comments?\nPlease advise.\nJh",
				"Definitely keeping this recipe! It&#8217;s funny because I actually went to DC for the first time this year and discovered Shouk after googling vegan restaurants and went back several times. I&#8217;ve been searching for a recipe comparable to their cardamom chocolate chip cookies and found this &#8211; then I read where you referenced them in your post! Thank you again!",
				"Hi, I was so looking forward to trying this vegan version of one of my favorite cookie recipe, chocolate and tahini!  I dodn&#8217;t have any more vegan butter in hand so I went for&#8230;.crisco, I know, I know. The cookies did not spread at all after 15 minutes, so I baked them way longer, without any success, they are crumbly and feel like the sugar never disolved at all!  So I&#8217;ll remake them with vegan butter or coconut oil because I need these in my life! \ud83d\ude09",
				"Would I be able to replace half the sugar with maple syrup or honey?",
				"these are delectable, I love how the tahini gives it a shortbread-like crumbly texture. \nin my go-to choc chip recipe that that uses coconut oil as a base the cookies don&#8217;t spread, so out of habit I flattened the first batch of these out and they turned out crunchy and brittle. i almost lost faith in the recipe! after i left the dough in balls, though, they spread to a delightfully thick and chewy cookie. a wonderful lesson in trusting the dough to do its job \ud83d\ude42",
				"These are delicious and are lovable to both vegans and non-vegans. I&#8217;ve adapted this for my vegan/gluten-free friends (used coconut flour) and they&#8217;re still amazing. I&#8217;m so glad I found this recipe!",
				"Warning: these cookies are addictive. I think I ate half a dozen before they were even fully cooled, they were that good! I used vegan butter and almond milk, and cooked them for just about 11 minutes.",
				"These (and the PB oatmeal cookies you posted later) are amazing!  People really love them.\n Have used both coconut oil and vegan butter stick (Melt brand), and find both work well. Lately I have been subbing coconut sugar for the brown sugar in both recipes (not for any health reason, just love the toffee taste it lends to baked goods),  and find it works well. Flavour improves even more after the dough is refrigerated for a few days.\nThank you so much for providing grams in your recipes!",
				"THese were amazing! I used spelt flour (its all I had) and 3/4 cup of coconut sugar, I know its annoying when ppl change the recipe :p but i just used what I had on hand. AMAZING! THANK YOU!",
				"I love these cookies! However they have a tendency to farll apart in people\u2019s hands. Is there\u2019 something I can do to make the  cookie more stable? Thank you!",
				"these tasted great but the inside of the cookie was a little grainy and i had to leave it in the oven for a long time. ANy idea of what possibly went wrong?",
				"These are my favourite cookies EVER!!! I have my 4th batch in the oven as I type \ud83d\ude42 thank you!",
				"Would also like to know this thanks \ud83d\ude42",
				"I don&#8217;t post comments often, but I had to this time.  Boy are these good! This is now my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe!  Thank you!",
				"Hello there?\nJust wondering if there\u2019s an option with less sugar?",
				"Can I replace the all purpose flour for oat flour and the granulated sugar for monk fruit?",
				"I made them with quinoa flour and they still tasted great! I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine!",
				"It was the sticks. I&#8217;ll try again with just coconut oil.",
				"I&#8217;m new to using EB (usually use coconut or avocado oils when baking) but had been having great results using it so far so I was surprised these spread so much. I think maybe they didn&#8217;t need the added milk.",
				"I tried making these with earth balance and tahini the consistency of runny pb and had the same problem the other commenter had: oily dough that wouldn&#8217;t firm up despite chilling. I used coconut sugar in place of brown but in my experience that doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ll skip adding any milk next time and add flour. They tasted very good, but didn&#8217;t resemble yours at all.",
				"Made these with black tahini and they turned out fantastic!",
				"I just made these cookies, but instead of coconut oil I used Earth Balance (I like the buttery flavor) and instead of nut milk I used finely shredded zucchini. I did need to cook them more around 15 minutes though, I think because of the moisture in the zucchini. They turned out great! \ud83d\ude42 Thank you!",
				"Hi Eva .. I can&#8217;t wait to make these cookies, they look amazing. Have you or  any of your followers tried making them with Gluten free flour or coconut flour?",
				"I don&#8217;t know what I did wrong but the dough was way too greasy, I put it in the fridge for 2 hours and it would crumble and drip in oil in my hands and it got very flat when baked, I like the idea of the tahini though&#8230;",
				"Hello!\nIf I were to substitute coconut oil for vegan butter, how much would I need?\nThank you!",
				"Great recipe, just making the second batch this week ?",
				"Hi there!!\nMay I please ask which type of plant based milk that you used in this recipe?\nThanks!",
				"I just made these with a few little changes and they turned out absolutely delicious! Such a great recipe! Thanks!"

				"1 medium (~5oz) zucchini",

			"serving": "2 14\" pizzas",
			"recipe": [
				"1. One hour before you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 550 \u00baF, or as hot as it will go. Place a rack one third of the way down from the top of the oven, and place a baking steel or baking stone on that rack. You want the oven to saturate with heat for 1 hour before baking pizza for best results.",
				"2. At this time also remove the pizza dough from the fridge so it can come to room temperature and the gluten can relax.",
				"3. Make the burst cherry tomatoes: Heat a deep heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the tablespoon of olive oil, the cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Cook for 7-8 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and charred in spots. Stir occasionally, and towards the end of the cooking time when they are soft enough, press them with a wooden spoon against the side of the pot until they burst open. Turn off the heat and set aside. The cherry tomatoes will splatter as they heat, so be mindful.",
				"4. Wash your zucchini and leave the top intact as this will act as a handle. Using a peeler, peel down the zucchini from just below the top stem all the way to the bottom to create a ribbon. Repeat until you've turned the entire zucchini into ribbons. Place in a mixing bowl.",
				"5. Next make your asparagus ribbons. Trim off the woody ends of the stalk and discard. Hold the tips of the asparagus and peel away from them to create ribbons out of each stalk and add to the zucchini ribbons. Reserve the asparagus tips and cut them in half, setting aside to top the pizza with.",
				"6. Toss the zucchini and asparagus ribbons with the lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp olive oil, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.",
				"7. When the oven is nice and hot, prepare your pizzas one at a time. Stretch (don't roll!) your dough to around 14-15\" diameter and place on a lightly floured pizza peel. Spread the garlic white sauce over the dough then sprinkle on about 1/2 of the vegan mozzarella and some fresh rosemary. On top of that add about 1/2 the zucchini and asparagus ribbons as well as 1/2 of the burst cherry tomatoes.",
				"8. Transfer the pizza onto the baking steel or pizza stone and bake for 8-10 minutes. Broil for an additional 1-2 minutes at the end if needed.",
				"9. If baking on a baking sheet, assemble the pizza straight on the metal and place directly in the oven.",
				"10. Repeat the pizza assembly and baking with the remaining dough.",
				"11. Let the pizza cool for a couple minutes before cutting and serve with crushed red pepper and an extra squeeze of lemon juice (if desired). Enjoy while hot!"

Add the lime juice, olive oil, curry powder, onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, salt, and a pinch of turmeric and blend to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Set aside to chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes for the flavors to meld and the dressing to cool. Makes ~1 1/4 cups dressing.",
				"3. Put the chickpeas in a large mixing bowl and mash slightly. We want most of the chickpeas to remain whole, but mashing a small portion of them helps the salad hold together while eating. Add the minced red onion, mango, and baby greens. Add 1/2 cup of the dressing and toss to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste, and more dressing if desired.",

				"Hi! Your recipe sounds amazing, but I&#8217;m allergic to coconut (nuts and peanuts too \ud83e\udd74), is there a way to substitute it and still have a &#8220;cheese&#8221; consistency?\nIn any case thanks for the effort you clearly made put in your recipes, I&#8217;ll try the asada this weekend!!",
				"We&#8217;ve used it to make enchiladas, salad and pizza.  It does soften on the pizza crust when you bake it, but not to the point of spilling over.",
				"If you every try making it again, let it sit for at least 24 hours.  The flavor is much better after a day.",
				"Amazing! I put this on setain asada tacos and it was wonderful",
				"Good flavor but doesn&#8217;t taste anything like queso fresco to me. The texture is somewhat crumbly but wet like a goat cheese. Barely any tang and I wish I&#8217;d added more citrus. The onion power imparts a nice flavor but that plus some of the remaining tofu flavor make it taste really different from queso fresco. I think this would be amazing on a bagel as is or with more herbs and spices.",
				"This recipe is amazing! I feel like it would be perfect in taquitos, enchiladas or quesadillas but I&#8217;m curious if it&#8217;s possible to use it in anything that&#8217;s going into a hot pan or oven because I imagine the coconut oil would melt into a liquid state. Have you tried using it like that before?",
				"can I skip the oil?",
				"Could I substitute the lemon with lime?",
				"Hi, I made this recipe about 5 days ago and have barely made a dent in it!! I am the only one who eats it and it made a lot more than I anticipated. I love it, it&#8217;s so good but I&#8217;m wondering how long it will last in the fridge?",
				"Loved this and have made it more than once now. Blanching the tofu really helps neutralize the tofu flavor.  Just for the fun of it, one time I added 1 preserved lemon to your fabulous original recipe which really bumped up the tanginess (which I love). Thank you so much for sharing.",
				"My cheese still in the fridge solidifying but I have just tried the cheese scraped with homemade bread and it tasted pretty good! I have made other cheese sauce before and didn&#8217;t like it but this one seems promising. I used garlic powder because I didn&#8217;t have onion powder, and used canola oil instead of the coconut oil. I used what I have. Thank you for sharing!",
				"Is coconut oil necessary or can you use a different oil?",
				"This cheese is delicious! I admit, I was skeptical, because like you, I had tried tofu based cheeses before and could not get past that beany taste, but I can&#8217;t detect that at all with this cheese! I have already eaten way too much of this! I put it on pasta, on top of salads, and spread on toast mixed with sun-dried tomatoes and diced onions. Thank you so much for creating these delicious vegan recipes!",
				"I made this once before and loved it!  I decided to make it again this morning, but didn\u2019t have any onion powder.  I subbed it with Everything but the Bagel seasoning!  It tastes so good!  I can\u2019t wait to have it tonight.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe.",
				"I discovered this recipe a few weeks ago and fell in love with it immediately.  It has to be one of the tastiest, easy to make dairy free cheese recipes ever.  I&#8217;ve been adding dill leaves and fennel seeds or dill leaves and finely minced sundried tomatoes to mine and the flavour is sooooooooooooo good.    Not a day goes by when I don&#8217;t have some of this truly amazing cheese &#8211; I can&#8217;t stop eating it.  And I&#8217;ve been sharing the recipe wherever I can.  Thank you so much for creating such an incredible recipe.",
				"This. Is. Brilliant.\nI found it took a full 24 hours for the flavors to blend and to get the crumbly consistency. Perfect on the seitan asada, and it\u2019s taken my avocado toast to a new level.\nThank you!",
				"I just found your blog from FoodGawker and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve lived this long without knowing your blog. What stellar recipes! I can&#8217;t wait to try, like, everything.",
				"I tried this and really wanted to like it &#8211; it was so easy! But it just tastes like salty tofu \ud83d\ude41 Going to try to add some spices to it and maybe turn it into a garlic &amp; herb spread."

				"Just prepared this dish and it\u2019s incredible!  Thank you so much for sharing!",
				"I\u2019m so excited to try this! I just have one question: should I use European bay leaf or Indian teja pat? I understand they\u2019re quite different in taste. Thanks!",
				"This is so flavorful and delicious. I\u2019ve made it several times \u2014 it\u2019s on my regular rotation. Thank you!",
				"Very delicious! I couldn&#8217;t find fenugreek at my grocery, but read online that ground mustard seed can be substituted so that&#8217;s what I did. Will definitely make again!",
				"Great recipe. I subbed potato for the tofu (steamed until just tender then and then followed the recipe)  and used a mix of greens including kale and broccoli greens as I didn\u2019t have enough silverbeet. Very tasty. Thank you.",
				"Hi there !  Looking forward to making the recipe tomorrow for some friends coming over for dinner.  I have organic ground fenugreek, no leaves.  Will this still work?  if yes, would it be the same measurements?\nCould Cumin be submitted for coriander seeds?  if yes, what measurements?\nAlso i think i would blend the sauce at the end to get a really creamy texture.  Would you advise doing this?  \nThank you so much!",
				"I made this the other night for my family. My daughter and I prefer eating vegan and we\u2019re slowly introducing the rest of the family to it. I was so excited at the prospect of having some of this as leftovers for lunch the next day but my dreams were shattered when my husband (the non vegan and fussy eater) finished every last bit. Everyone loved it and it will now be a staple recipe in our household. I served it with homemade garlic naan and cumin basmati rice.",
				"What quantity of f frozen spinach did you use?",
				"I made this today during my lockdown and it brought joy that I could make my favorite indian dish without the cheese. It turned out very satisfying and spicy just how I like it. I  dish was so creamy I forgot to add the coconut cream. I will try this next time!",
				"I love Saag paneer.\nThis dish came out perfect in taste and texture.  The tofu was so cheese like in texture it made  one forget that there was no cheese inside the dish ,  I used about three times the amount of nutritional yeast called for in the recipe. This imparted more cheesy flavor.\nThanks for this recipe and for the. Website.",
				"Hey I want to try this but I\u2019m not sure what kind of tofu to use . Do I use soft, firm or extra firm? Do I press the tofu?",
				"I&#8217;ve made this twice now and really enjoy it!! The spice blend for the tofu is delicious and is a great way to eat tofu on it&#8217;s own too. I also use thawed frozen spinach which seems to need maybe double the water. I like to add quite a bit of lemon juice at the end and I use double the ginger. Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe!",
				"Made this tonight but slightly adapted to what was available: I used frozen spinach, thawed out and blended. Also smoked tofu!!\nI must admit I needed to add a lot of water and some extra salt.\nThe result was truly delicious and your spice blend was perfect.

				"1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer add the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Whisk to combine. Add the warm water, oil, and barley malt syrup if using. Mix the ingredients together until you've formed a shaggy dough.",
				"2. To make by hand: Turn the dough out onto a clean counter. Knead by hand for 3 minutes. If needed, add a little extra flour (a tablespoon at a time), but expect the dough to start out sticky and get less sticky, turning more tacky, as you knead. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 4-5 minutes until you have a smooth and slightly tacky dough. The dough should be soft and a bit bouncy.",
				"3. If using a stand mixer:  Using the dough hook, knead the dough on low speed for 3 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then turn the stand mixer back on and knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead by hand for 1-2 minutes, making any final adjustments to add more flour if needed. The final dough should be soft, bouncy, smooth, and slightly tacky.",
				"4. Place the dough into a lightly oiled large mixing bowl and turn to coat the dough in oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a lightly dampened towel and let rise for 1 hour. The dough should be 1 1/2 to 2x risen in volume.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 400 \u00baF.",
				"6. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and divide until 8 equal pieces. Form each piece of dough into a ball, rolling the ball seam side down under your palm in small circles to create a taught skin around the ball of dough. Let rest for 5 minutes, then shape the balls into rolls. Roll the ball under your hands to form a torpedo or [American] football shape, 4-5\" long. The edges will be slightly tapered with the center remaining round. Press down the tops of the dough to flatten slightly, so they are about 3/4\" tall. Place the shaped rolls on a parchment lined baking sheet with 1 1/2-2\" between each roll as they will expand in the oven. Lightly mist the tops of the rolls with oil then loosely cover with plastic wrap.",
				"7. Let the dough rise for a second time while the oven preheats. After 20-30 minutes the rolls will have swollen, as much as 50%. At this point they are ready to bake.",
				"8. Brush the tops of the rolls with some plant milk of your choice for a shinier finish. Then using a bread lame or a lightly oiled sharp knife, slash the bread either with one cut down the center length wise or two parallel diagonal lines.",
				"9. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the loaves are a beautiful golden brown (Note: if you did not use the barley malt the loaves will not darken as much). Let cool completely before consuming."

				"@Kat, it&#8217;s very common practice to read the entire recipe before actually beginning. In fact, in my seventeen years working professionally in kitchens, it&#8217;s been my experience with every baker and chef I&#8217;ve worked with that it&#8217;s considered pretty basic knowledge that you should actually read the recipe twice, measure once, and then begin. You might want to adapt in the future.\nWork smarter, not harder.",

I had to do the recipe by hand and my hands are aching fat well worth it I also had to try a piece before I serve them with butter of course for quality control and they were wonderful highly recommended it. I did not have the barley malt syrup but they turned out just fine",

I made 6 (long) large rolls to make veal sandwiches with and they were wonderful; loaded on the tomato sauce, breaded veal, roasted peppers and sauteed mushrooms and these sturdy buns held it all.  Delicious!!!   I substituted 1 tsp of molasses instead of the 2 tsp of  barley malt syrup and the colour worked perfectly.  I put the molasses into the warm water and added the 2 tsp of yeast and proofed it for about 6 minutes.  After the mixer I kneaded for 6 minutes.  I also used microwave-melted margarine instead of plant milk for brushing the tops of buns and I brushed the leftover margarine several times between uses onto the knife to make the slits. I will definitely make these again!  Thank you for this no-fail recipe.",

				"3. Roast the head of garlic alongside the eggplant. Remove the excess papery skin and cut off the top of the head of garlic to expose the cloves. Pour a little olive oil over the top of the bulb and wrap in aluminum foil. Bake for 35-40 minutes.",
				"4. Once the eggplant and garlic are roasted wait until they are cool enough to handle. Scoop the flesh out of the eggplant and the roasted cloves from the head of garlic.

Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a simmer, lower the heat and cover the pot with the lid ajar. Let the sauce simmer for at least 25-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. Taste and add the sugar if the sauce is a little tart.",

In a small food processor add 1 1/2 cups of the cooked lentils, pecans, sun dried tomatoes, the marinara sauce (don't worry if it's still simmering away, it's still good to add!), garlic, onion powder and the flax mixture. Process until it's well combined and somewhat mushy. The mixture shouldn't be a smooth puree, but won't have much texture left. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and add the remaining 1/2 cup of lentils and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. Mix together to form a firm and non-sticky mixture. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of bread crumbs if needed.",

				"This is one of my favorite recipes for polenta.  Very tasty. I would not have thought of using Cajun spices!",
				"This looks great! One suggestion, though &#8211; because my south-Louisiana-born self can&#8217;t resist! If you want a more authentic Cajun flavor, instead of garlic + scallions for the base, start with a combination of onion + celery + bell pepper, then the garlic and add top with the green part of the scallion when serving. Onion + celery + bell pepper is the &#8220;Holy Trinity&#8221; of Cajun cuisine. (I hope you don&#8217;t mind the suggestion! Thanks for showing a little love to Cajun cooking!)",
				"I love soy curls!  They are not like TVP (made from soy flour) but the whole beans so no processing other than drying.  I have found they taste even better if I soak them in vegan chick&#8217;n stock instead of just the water. Just bought the bulk box (12 pounds!) of them to split with my daughter&#8230; so we will be eating lots of soy curls for sure.  As long as you keep them in a freezer they last for ages.  Cheapest price I found for the bulk was direct from Butler Foods in case anyone is interested.",
				"This was delicious and satisfying. I cant wait to try different spice combinations."

				"Just a followup.  Next day had more fresh spinach so braised it with carrots, Italian pepper, leeks, etc. in a little white wine.  Then made potato and turnip (1 turnip to 4 potatoes) mash, folding in the remaining cheese.  Well it (the cheese) seemed to have matured overnight.  I&#8217;d have sworn that it was a strong mature English cheddar.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\nI&#8217;m starting to lose my resistance to becoming vegan.  And Eva is responsible!  Next the biryani, my favourite indian dish, so fingers crossed.",
				"Eva this is great in all four parts.  I normally resist commenting on recipes as I can never resist changing this or that.  But today we had lots going on so I stuck to the recipe.  I got the sauce and the cheese done early.  The crepe batter I only left for 20 mins but the little tester worked fine.  I did add a red onion to the spinach.  \nMy vegan wife loved all four elements.  She found the sauce exquisite (no exaggeration) and I thought the cheese was better than my former almond cheese recipe.  Really cheesy.  \nI&#8217;d recommend these need eating out the pan (immediately).  Or maybe when we have more than two I need to experiment with cooking and keeping the crepes hot without them drying (any thoughts).  \nBut great recipe.

To make a rosette, thinly cut the mango width-wise, to make short slices and separate the slices so they are only overlapping about 1/2 to 1/3 of the way. Roll the mangoes in so that the slices wrap around each other to make the rosette. Gently transfer the rosette using a spatula onto the chilled pastry. Lightly press the mango down so it sinks into the pastry cream just a little. Alternatively you can cut the mangoes into slightly thicker slices widthwise and arrange them over the pastry cream as desired.",

				"Thank you so much for this incredible recipe!  You made my day! I have made several vegan Mac and cheese recipes only to be very disappointed.  My whole family loved this and it seriously took care of our cheese cravings (giving up cheese has been the hardest part of becoming vegan for us). It&#8217;s surprisingly easy to make and so worth it! I will make this again and again. I used tofu instead of tempeh and it was very delicious but had to bake longer.. Looking forward to trying with tempeh.\nThank you again ?"

				"1 tsp salt",

				"cilantro, for garnish (optional)"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 15 minutes",
			"serving": "6-8 servings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. First cook the potatoes for the kofta. Peel and cut the potatoes in half, then place them in a pot and cover with water. Place a lid on the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium and let boil for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fully cooked and easily pierced with a fork. Drain the hot water from the potatoes, mash them until smooth, and set aside.",
				"2. While the potatoes are cooking, start the curry tomato cream sauce. In a large heavy bottomed pot add the onion, canned tomatoes and their juices, cashews, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, and salt. If you are using fenugreek seeds instead of kasoori methi, also add the fenugreek seeds at this point. Cover the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer covered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
				"3. Transfer the onion and tomato mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, making sure to vent so hot air doesn't build up in the blender. Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender, but the final sauce will not be as silky smooth. Pour the creamy mixture back into the pot and add the coconut milk, reserving ~1/4 cup back to serve and crush the methi in your fingers and add to the pot. Mix together and cover the pot and set aside until the kofta are ready.",
				"4. In a large mixing bowl, mash the tofu by squeezing it in your hands until it's creamy and no chunks remain. You want to have the texture of ricotta. Alternatively you can blend it in a small food processor until smooth.",
				"5. Add the mashed potatoes to the mashed tofu along with the corn starch, minced cilantro, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt. Mix together and test the consistency by forming some into a ball. It should hold together. It can stick to your hands a little, but if it is very sticky or too wet and falling apart, you can add a bit more corn starch. This can vary depending on what brand and variety of tofu you use, but the recipe is quite flexible. Mix in the frozen peas. Shape the kofta mixture into heaping 1 tablespoon portions and roll into balls or into a football shape (a torpedo).",
				"6. To fry the kofta: Heat about 2-inches of high heat safe oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Test the oil either with a thermometer until it is 325-350 \u00baF or you can test with a small piece of the kofta mixture: the oil should bubble/boil vigorously around it and the kofta should float to the surface fairly quickly after being dropped in. When the oil is heated fry the shaped kofta in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, until the kofta is a beautiful dark golden brown color, flipping halfway through for even cooking. This should take 5-10 minutes, depending on the temperature of your oil, how much oil you have heated (more oil means the temperature is more stable when you add the kofta), and how many kofta you add at once. When the kofta are cooked, transfer to a paper towel lined plate with a wire spider strainer. Repeat with remaining batched of kofta until all are cooked.",
				"7. To bake the kofta: Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF. Line a baking tray with parchement and spray or brush with oil. Arrange the shaped kofta onto the baking tray so there is 1/2-1\" between each kofta. Spray or brush the tops with oil. Bake for 30-40 minutes, flipping after the first 15-20 minutes, until both sides are golden and the edges of the kofta are crispy and chewy. It's normal for the kofta to lose their shape a little and flatten when baked.",
				"8. When ready to serve, pour the sauce overtop the kofta (only use what you will eat in one sitting, as the kofta get soggy once in the sauce), then pour the reserved coconut milk over top the kofta. Garnish with cilantro if desired. Enjoy with Indian flatbread and/or basmati rice."

				"This is my whole family&#8217;s favorite, it&#8217;s so flavorful yet mild that even my little ones ask for more! I fried the first few times then tried baking, and was really impressed with how well they still came out! They reheat perfectly in the air fryer the next day too. Wanted to finally leave a comment today as I pull up the recipe to make a celebratory last-day-of-school dinner!",
				"Ok I never comment on recipes but this was just too good not to brag.  Everything had so much flavor and even my picky toddler needed more.  Definitely the new family favorite.",
				"It looks delicious and am looking forward to making it. But, would it be possible to list metric measurements as well. I am always confused on whether pounds refer to Imperial pounds or American pounds! It could make a substantial difference!",
				"Amazing. I&#8217;ve made it twice now and it&#8217;s a big treat. We make basmati and flat breads for the side so it becomes a big thing, but just *this* dish by itself isn&#8217;t as time consuming as it originally seemed!",
				"Is it possible to cook the dumplings in an air fryer?",
				"my dumplings didnt turn out so well.  I used arrowroot I dont know if that makes a difference.  They are really sticky, almost gooey and they are not frying up as pretty.  Could I add some flour to it (almond or chickpea) to make it keep its shape better?",

It&#8217;s got everything &#8211; spice, fragrance, crispy-crunch, creaminess and its healthy to boot!  I order kofta when dining out where I can, but none has compared to this.  Make it according to the recipe, but it won&#8217;t mind being fussed with if needed.",

				"I was excited to find this recipe, I used to love Malai Kofta, but vegan recipes usually had squash which I don&#8217;t like. I also don&#8217;t like tofu (a picky vegan for 16 years, it&#8217;s terrible!), but these didn&#8217;t taste tofu-y at all. I had a 300 gr box of firm tofu and maybe 75gr of silken tofu, so I used both. Only needed 1/4c of cornflour and they turned out really nice with that very long bake at high heat. We found the flavor very low key, so making them again, I would kick up all the spices by quite a bit. Definitely a keeper though. Thanks.",
				"I made this tonight and it was phenomenal!  If you are thinking about making this please do.  It was so delicious!! Thank you so much for a great recipe.",
				"I almost never leave reviews on food blogs (or anywhere really), but this is one of the best recipes that I have ever made! I could not believe that I had made something that tastes like it could be served at a restaurant. This is one of my favourite recipes of all time and have already made it multiple times. If there are any leftovers (rare), it also makes a great hiking snack (packed separately and using the sauce as a dip)!! Thank you so much for this recipe!",
				"Made this and loved it!!!\nOne thing I did change was that I didnt have regular yellow potatoes (went to grab then from the pantry and they had loooong roots&#8230;lol) so I used steamed sweet potatoes and man, it was divine! I also couldn&#8217;t find fenugreek, so omitted it, and it was still so good. Highly recommend. I went the baking route, finished in my air fryer and the kofta was great!\nThanks for this recipe.",
				"I love this recipe! So does my non vegan husband and family! Can these be frozen? I&#8217;d like to make up a big batch and have extras for a quick dinner. I&#8217;ll freeze the sauce prior to adding the coconut milk.",

				"Made these for the family last night and they turned out perfect!  Although not strictly vegan my hubby doesn&#8217;t eat land animals and is lactose intolerant so avoids dairy.  I also am keen to transition to a more plant based diet so vegan versions of our favourite meals are great for easing us all into healthier eating and these Malai Kofta certainly fit the bill perfectly!\nRecipe came together easily &#8211; I used my potato ricer to mash the potatoes and the tofu and the kids rolled the koftas.  I choose to deep fry the balls at the temp specified in your recipe and they held together perfectly and came out lovely and crunchy on the outside and deliciously creamy inside.  I followed the suggestion of serving the koftas and sauce separately meaning the balls stayed nice and crisp and we all agreed they were amazing.\nSeems like a recipe that would freeze really well to.  Next time I&#8217;ll be making a double or triple batch, lightly frying the balls I wish to freeze, laying them on a tray to freeze they packing in vacuum bags to freeze long term.  That way I should be able to finish cooking the balls in the oven (if I had an air fryer that would be even better I think) and simply reheat the sauce in a pot for a super fast and easy busy day meal.\nThanks for a great recipe!!

				"Hi,\nCan you freeze the dumpling mixture? Thanks!",
				"Hello! This recipe looks great! Quick question &#8211; can I use dry peas instead of frozen ones? If so, should I cook them first? Thanks!",
				"Thanks, I went ahead and purchased Yukons.  Great recipe.  Thanks!",
				"Anyone try this with regular Idaho potatoes?  Have them on hand, but no Yukon.",
				"This was so delicious! My non-vegan family loved it, too! I baked the kofta and they were light and fluffy and went perfectly with the curry sauce. Thanks for the recipe!",
				"Can I mix the tofu and potato, leave it in the fridge overnight, then bring to room temperature and fry the next day?",
				"Delicious! Tofu &amp; potatoes make the perfect combination for vegan malai kofta. Love this recipe. Thank you.",
				"I deep  fried several kofta balls that looked like they were crisping nicely but then fell apart when I tried to turn them&#8230; the dough also stuck to the bottom of the pan something awful. Then I reread the temperature for the recipe and realized I was frying them at 250 instead of the 300 to 350 degrees per the recipe.  Such a sad waste of the first bits of dough.  But once I corrected the temperature everything came out beautifully, soft on the inside crunchy on the outside and oh so tasty!!   I made both fried and baked kofta.  I probably left the baked kofta  in oven a bit too long as they flattened out and also had a \u201chollow\u201d center.  They were also very crunchy  on the outside. They wound up looking more like a cookie than a meatball. Probably not ideal shape &amp; texture, but very tasty in their own right. (Could probably serve as a crunchy appetizer&#8230;..The next time I make the baked ones  I would follow the temperature and time more carefully as I think I may have baked them a little too long.. I made the sauce the next day and reheated the kofta  in the oven on a baking tray.   I have never had kofta before, so I can\u2019t compare, but I have to say everything tasted  fabulous!  I would give this 5 out of 5 stars and would 100 percent make these again!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!",
				"Hi, this was delicious, I am making it for the second time today after my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner after she had it the first time a couple months ago!  It tastes so much like my favorite Indian restaurant&#8217;s version of this dish!   However, I have to suggest you revise the preparation time.  I&#8217;m not an inexperienced or inefficient cook, this is my second go at this recipe, and I have just completed making the balls and it took me a full hour to make and get them in the oven.  Peeling potatoes, mashing them up and mashing up the tofu, not to mention forming the balls&#8211;I can&#8217;t imagine that anyone could do even this part in just 15 minutes!!!  I assume I could make the sauce while they bake (I&#8217;m going to make the sauce a bit later) but even so that would take a full hour and a half of active time to get this meal on the table.  Nonetheless it&#8217;s well worth all the time and effort!",

				"Hi Eva, could you use chick pea flower instead of corn flower?\nMany Thanks\nRaj",
				"??? this is amazing thank you for sharing!!",
				"I made this and it was terrific. I used no oil and just 1/4 cup corn starch (as opposed to 1/2 cup) and the  dumplings held together just fine.  I recommend making a double or even triple batch of the sauce because I had way more dumplings than sauce with the above recipe.",
				"This looks great! Just curious though, if you want the tofu smooth, why not use silken tofu?",
				"I made this today and I&#8217;ve never left a comment on a recipe before. Although my baked koftas flattened in the oven (like cookies, I assume because it was too wet) they were delicious and the sauce was brilliant. My entire family couldn&#8217;t stop eating them including my picky preschooler who kept eating them from my plate. Thank you for this and I plan on making many more of your dishes.",

Is heavy cream absolutely necessary for this recipe? if yes, can you suggest some substitute for it?\nThank you! \ud83d\ude42",
				"I&#8217;ve made this twice now. The first time I didn&#8217;t have the fenugreek leaves and it was good, but tonight I added the leaves and wow! What a difference! This is absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing!",

				"I went vegan (from vegetarian) about eight months ago and malai kofta/paneer makhani sauce was the one thing I\u2019ve been desperately craving ever since. When I came across your recipe, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect and was a bit doubtful that it would taste as good as the real thing, but I decided to give it a try and it was AMAZING! If I didn\u2019t make it myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe it was vegan. Thank you so much for filling this void in my life \ud83d\ude42",
				"Made the Malai Kofta and it was delicious. Especially the creamy sauce. That was as good as the sauce I get at my favourite Indian restaurant . Going to try making the naan next\nThank you",
				"This is an excellent dish, so thank you for sharing!! My husband who is not vegan loved it so much he ate it three days in a row until all kofta were gone. Although the kofta and sauce was delish, seeing the picture of your balls, I know that mine did not cook properly. I meant to deep fry and tried following the recipe which says to put 2 inches of oil in a pan on med-low. I must have ended up doing more of a pan fry because the outside wasn&#8217;t a deep golden brown and pieces of the kofta fell off into the pan during the process. I think that next time it will require a higher temp &#8211; maybe more like a med-high and more oil so that the entire ball is submerged in oil.",
				"I made a half recipe tonight and it turned out great.  I did bake the koftas rather than frying, but otherwise (almost) followed the recipe as written.  I did soak the cashews, as I worried they might not blend well.  i also sauteed the onion a bit before adding the tomatoes.  Lastly, I added some roasted jalapeno (I had half of one in the fridge I needed to use) and some red chili pepper in place of the cayenne and was quite happy to have a very spicy tomato gravy.",
				"I just made this tonight! We loved it. All had seconds. I doubled the cayenne based on the author\u2019s comments but otherwise did the recipe as directed. It took me quite a bit longer than the recipe indicated, but it might go faster the next time. I may make the meatballs the day before another time. But there will be a next time!",
				"I made these yesterday since we did our official Christmas dinner a few days ago. These are delicious! And the sauce! To die for! I want to put it on everything from now on!",
				"This was soooooo good! It\u2019s going into the regular dinner rotation. Thanks!",
				"My husbands favorite Indian dish is malai Kofta but I am allergic to dairy. I made this last night and everyone in the family LOVED it! so tasty. I fried the dumplings. I think I may serve them on the table to be made one at a time because that first one- with the outside crispy and the inside soft was so amazing. After a bit the sauce makes them soft. Still good&#8230;but man that first one!\nThank you!",
				"I like the idea of a vegan dish. Could one not make this with a vegan ricotta? The recipe sounds delish. Cannot wait to try it. Yummy",
				"I forgot to rate it!\n5*",
				"Made the sauce to go with some pre-made pakoras&#8230;\nit is truly *amazing* !!!\nI was skeptical with no frying, but seriously this is awesome, thank you!",
				"Meant to say super delicious**\nI read the other comment about adding more arrowroot powder so will try that! \n\ud83d\ude42",
				"Hey, I made this last night and it was upset delicious. However, I tried both baking and frying the kofta and they didn\u2019t turn out writhe times. When frying they just kind of stuck to the bottom of the pan and mostly fell apart even though I did roll them into a ball/little patty. When I baked them the insides were mostly hollow. They browned on the outside but the insides must have leaked out. Would I just need to add more arrowroot powder and make them firmer? Thank you for this amazing recipe!",
				"Was very excited to try this tonight, but for some reason all the kofta completely fell apart when I fried them. Before I  put them in the pot they were perfect little balls, so it should have worked. I ended up throwing all of it away and just buying veggieballs from the  store. Do you have any idea what could have gone wrong? I really want to make this recipe work!",
				"We made this tonight&#8230;.it was amazing! Enough for tomorrow. We will definitely make it again. &#8230;.loved the flavors. Accidentally put in astofaeda instead of fenugreek&#8230;.and then added it after all. Still tasted ok, I think. Thanks so much&#8230;. hoping to try out some of your others",
				"Thank you for this recipe!! I have made it on 2 occasions and has gone down a treat both times. I had a friend who would usually turn down a meal without meat say it was the best curry he had ever eaten.\nI substituted half the potato for sweet potato, twice the amount of cashews and chilli flakes for some heat x",
				"This dish was absolutely amazing!! Thank you for sharing!",
				"Thank you for the recipe\nI did have an issue with it though. The dough for the koftas came out way too wet and I had to add a lot more cornstarch. I&#8217;m thinking this is because I don&#8217;t have a scale so I had to estimate my tofu and potatoes, or because I processed the entire dough mixture instead of mashing the potatoes by hand.\nI deep fried the koftas and they stuck to the bottom of the deep fryer basket. Also, some of them burst open with a loud pop! I suppose the pressure from the heat became too much for them?\nThe sauce came out well. It was easy and came out tasting pretty similar to sauces I&#8217;ve had at Indian restaursnts even though I couldn&#8217;t find the fenugreek and omitted it.\nI&#8217;m going to try this recipe again but using a scale and not processing the dough\nMy recommendations are to add raisins and cashew pieces to the kofta dough. They need more texture and flavor\nThe best kofta I&#8217;ve had has raisins in it and the sweetness really complements the savory flavors well\nDo you have any other recommendations for fixing the mistake I made ?",
				"This is absolutely delicious! Fancy, but fairly easy to put together. The sauce is so good and the potato balls are crispy and delightful\nWould highly suggest making!",
				"Hi Eva, thanks for the great recipe! I just ate it all and it was so delicious and creamy and tasty&#8230; lovely!",
				"I\u2019m sitting waiting for the  kofta to bake and if they aren\u2019t finished soon the sauce is going to be gone!  It is absolutely amazing!   We like things a little spicy in my house so I added some extra cayenne pepper. I could seriously eat it all!   Can\u2019t wait to taste the kofta!",
				"As a vegan, a major miss has been Malai kofta [that and shahi paneer too \ud83d\ude09 ] Just finished eating this for dinner! It turned out phenomenally. We added a bit more cashews for extra nuttiness. The winning aspect was the kofta!  The consistency was perfect. Thanks so much for blessing our taste buds with this dish!",
				"Thank you so much with this recipe! I made the sauce today (with potatoes, peas and paneer instead of the dumplings) and I loved it.",
				"I want to attempt these in my air fryer. I just made some wonderful falafel in it, which worked out great, so I began thinking, why not malai kofta too?\nI love malai kofta, and really miss not eating it since becoming vegan. Your recipe has great comments, so I trust your spice mix! Often Indian recipes online don\u2019t taste at all like restaurant food, but yours looks great!\nThanks!",
				"I really want to try this durng the weekend! But I want to ask if the kofta balls are mixed in a food processor or just mixed by hand? If mixed in a food processor it will result in smooth texture throughout the ball, but then I don&#8217;t get the specific point of frozen peas. So maybe they&#8217;re too be left whole in the mix?  Thanks!",
				"My family loves this recipe! Aside from Vegetable Korma, this Malai Kofta is my kids favorite dish! I add raisins to the veggie balls to sweeten it up. Tonight will be my third time making this recipe!  It\u2019s our go to Birtbday dinner recipe! Thank you so much!",
				"Never mind!",

I added eggplant and snow peas as I had some that were just going to go to waste otherwise. I think eggplant fits really well in this curry!\nLastly, i tend not to like overwhelming coconut flavour so i only used one can snd put more broth.  Next time, i will follow your instructions! I think i will enjoy it!!\nThat recipe is a keeper ? will do it again!",

The mixture will be thick and glossy at this point. Agar melts at around 185 \u00baF, so you can check with a thermometer that it has reached this temperature. Water boils at 212 \u00baF, so if once it's simmering it should have reached that temperature. Stir in the jalape\u00f1os and red pepper flakes (if using).",

				"2 tbsp (25g) granulated sugar",
				"1/8 tsp fine sea salt",
				"1 tsp (5mL) vanilla extract",

				"12oz (285g) 70% dark chocolate",
				"ground hazelnuts, for melted chocolate finish option or a dusting finish on the tempered chocolate",
				"56-60 whole toasted hazelnuts (optional)",
				"flaked salt, such as Maldon sea salt, for tempered chocolate finish option (optional)"
			],
			"time": "4 hours 35 minutes",
			"serving": "56-60 small truffles",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Finely chop the 8oz of chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.",
				"2. In a small pot bring the hazelnut milk, sugar, and salt to a simmer. Whisk a couple of times as it heats to dissolve the sugar.",
				"3. Once simmering, remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Rotate the bowl to swirl the milk and submerge the chocolate. Cover the bowl with a plate or lid and let sit undisturbed for 4-5 minutes.",
				"4. At this point the chocolate should be warm and melty. Add the vanilla extract and the olive oil, then whisk the chocolate, until the mixture is smooth. Start in the center and work out towards the edges as the chocolate melts and the ganache forms.",
				"5. Test the ganache for texture by dipping a small spoon into the melty ganache, then placing it in the fridge on a small plate. After 15 minutes the ganache should be firm and creamy. If it is too hard, you can whisk in an additional couple teaspoons of hazelnut milk.",
				"6. Pour the ganache into a 9\" baking dish or pyrex storage container (line the bottom with parchment or plastic wrap if you want to make rectangular truffles). Let the ganache cool to room temperature, then place it in the fridge uncovered. Let the ganache chill until the top is firm to the touch, then cover with plastic wrap or parchment so that it is touching the top of the ganache. Let the ganache firm up in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or overnight. It can last in the fridge for up to 1 week.",
				"7. When ready to shape the truffle centers, prepare a rimmed baking sheet or shallow baking dish by lining with parchment paper. Use a small 1/2-tablespoon scoop to make uniform truffles, or use a heaping teaspoon or eyeball 3/4\" rounds and scoop with a small spoon. If desired, place a single toasted hazelnut inside the ganache, pushing it in, then manipulating the soft ganache to cover the hazelnut. Regardless, roll each scoop between the palms of your hand to form a sphere. Don't worry about it being perfectly round. Wash the chocolate off your palms as necessary to prevent sticking. Shape the ganache with dry hands. If the ganache gets to warm to shape, stick it in the refrigerator or freezer until it's firmed up again.",
				"8. If shaping into rectangles, remove the ganache from the container and place on a cutting board. Put a mug filled with hot water next to your work station, and a paper towel or kitchen towel next to you. Warm a sharp knife in the hot water, then dry with the towel. Cut the ganache into your desired shapes, warming the knife as needed between cuts.",
				"9. Set each truffle center on the parchment paper, covering with parchment paper and adding layers of truffles as necessary until all centers are shaped. Place in the fridge to firm up for at least 20 minutes before coating with your choice of chocolate finish, or up to overnight. You can also freeze them for longer, but move to the refrigerator at least 4 hours before dipping in the chocolate finish.",
				"10. Melt the chocolate using a water bath technique or in the microwave. To use a water bath, bring a small pot of water to a low simmer and place a heat proof bowl over top the pot. The bottom of the bowl should NOT be touching the water or the chocolate can burn. Let the chocolate start to look melty, then stir with a silicon spatula. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted. Remove from the heat and set up your work station.",
				"11. Have the chocolate centers on the parchment paper next to the bowl of melted chocolate. On a plate spread a layer of ground hazelnuts for coating.",
				"12. Using a chocolate dipping tool or a fork, dip each ganache center into the melted chocolate, rolling around to fully coat, then place on plate and roll in ground hazelnuts to coat. Place the truffle back onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with each center until you've finished all of them. Place in the fridge to firm up. Keep these truffles stored in a sealed container in the fridge, but you can remove them an hour before serving so they are not cold.",
				"13. Remove your ganache centers from the refrigerator and temper the chocolate.",
				"14. First, reserve one good-sized chunk (~1 1/2 - 2\") of chocolate from your 12oz of chocolate. Finely chop the remaining chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.",
				"15. Bring a small amount of water to a simmer over low heat and place the bowl of chocolate over the pot. The bowl of chocolate should NOT touch the water or the chocolate can burn.*IMPORTANT: make sure that no water touches the melted chocolate or the chocolate will seize and you will NOT be able to temper it.",
				"16. Warm the chocolate over the water bath, whisking occasionally, until melted. It should be 100-110 \u00baF. Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let cool to the low 80-degrees F, whisking regularly to encourage crystallization. When the temperature reaches the low 80s F, add the reserved chunk of chocolate and bring the melted chocolate back up to 88-90 \u00baF. To do this, place it over the barely simmering pot of water for a few seconds, then remove and whisk vigorously. Check the temperature and repeat as necessary until you've reached the 88 \u00baF. Be very careful and slow here so you do not jump back up to over 91 \u00baF and lose your tempering. If that happens, let the mixture cool back down, re-seed with another chunk of chocolate and try again.",
				"17. Once you've reached that 88-90 \u00baF, check that the chocolate is tempered. Smear a small amount of the chocolate on a plate and it should harden and turn shiny within a few minutes.",
				"18. Keep the chocolate between this 88-90 \u00baF range and dip the truffle centers in the chocolate. It's easiest to work with the chocolate dipping forks. Dip the ganache center in, rolling to fully coat, then pull up and let some chocolate drip down, then wipe off the bottom of the fork on the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate before transferring to the parchment lined tray. Immediately sprinkle with ground nuts or a couple of flakes of salt for garnish. Alternatively, you can use a piping bag with a tiny hole to drizzle a little tempered chocolate over top all of them once finished.",
				"19. Keep the tempered chocolate off the heat while you continue to dip the truffles. Check the temperature as you go, and if it starts to cool off much under 88\u00baF, place it back on the warm bowl of water just for a few seconds, whisk and recheck the temperature. If you leave the bowl of chocolate over the hot water, it may get too hot and you will need to re-temper.",
				"20. Any extra tempered chocolate can be spread into a mold, or poured over a piece of parchment paper and allowed to harden. It can just be enjoyed as you would a chocolate bar!",
				"21. Let the chocolate truffles set at room temperature, or speed the process by putting in the fridge for a few minutes. These truffles can be stored at room temperature. Note that if you used the flaked salt to decorate the truffles, over the course of a couple of days, the salt may pull moisture from the air and chocolate and the salt can look melty. This is especially true if it is very humid out."

				"1. Sort the dried beans, removing any small stones and debris, then rinse the beans. For faster, more evenly cooked beans, pre-soak them. You can either soak for 8-10 hours in about 10 cups of cold water along with 1 1/2 tbsp of coarsely ground salt. Or you can quick soak the beans by placing them in a large pot with the 10 cups of water and the 1 1/2 tbsp coarse salt, and bringing the pot of beans to a rolling boil, turn off heat and leave covered for 1 hour at room temperature. If you choose not to soak your beans, oven cooking time can be expected to increase.",
				"2. Preheat the oven to 300 \u00baF. If beans have been soaked, drain and rinse them. Put the beans in a large, oven safe, dutch oven. Cover with 8 cups of water, add 1 tsp of finely ground salt, 2 bay leaves, and the epazote or Mexican oregano. Bring the pot to a boil on the stovetop, then transfer the covered pot to the 300 \u00baF oven.",
				"3. Prepare the head of garlic for roasting. Peel off the excess paper around the garlic, and slice off a small portion of the top to expose the cloves. Place the head of garlic in a small piece of foil and pour 1 tsp of oil overtop. Close the foil around the head of garlic and place it in the oven with the pot.",
				"4. Let the beans cook and the garlic roast for 75 minutes. After 75 minutes remove the head of garlic, which should be soft and well roasted at this point. Open up the foil packet, and set the roasted garlic aside to cool. Test the beans for doneness. They should be soft and easily squished by your tongue. If they are firm, continue baking them, checking every 10-15 minutes, until they are tender.",
				"5. When the beans are cooked, return the pot to the stove and turn the heat to medium or medium-low to maintain an active simmer. When the roasted garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and add them all to the pot of beans along with the canned tomatoes with green chile. Let the beans simmer until the liquid is thickened and turning creamy and the beans are soft and practically melt in your mouth, usually 20-25m. Stir the beans occasionally while it cooks so none stick to the bottom. If the mixture gets too dry you can add a little more water as needed",
				"6. Heat a skillet over medium, add 1 tbsp of oil and the diced onion. Fry the onion for 6-8 minutes until soft and golden. Add to the onions to the thickened beans and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Taste the beans and adjust for salt.",
				"7. The beans will thicken as they cool and sit in the fridge. Any that won't be consumed in a few days can be frozen. The beans freeze really well. Just defrost on the counter or in the fridge.",
				"8. Rinse the rice and put in a medium pot along with the 3 cups of water, oil (if using), and salt. Bring the pot to a low boil while uncovered, then turn the heat down to low, cover, and let steam for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, check that the rice is tender. If not give it another 2-5 minutes, and add a splash of hot water if it's running dry. Typically the water is not needed.",
				"9. When the rice is cooked, add the chopped tomatillos on top of it, and leave covered to steam untouched for 10 minutes.",
				"10. Add the cilantro and the lime juice over top, then fluff the rice with a fork and mix in the tomatillos, cilantro, and lime. Keep the rice covered and warm until ready to serve."

				"I love all your comments on beans:  eating and cooking!  I have been cooking brown rice in the oven for a while now and it beats any other method I&#8217;ve tried.  When I read your suggestion of cooking beans in the oven, I thought, yes, of course!!  I usually use a crock pot which works well or sometimes a pressure cooker, which is iffy for pinto beans.  Since becoming a vegetarian 7 years ago, I have fallen in love with beans.  They are so versatile and tasty.  I love them in soups, on pizza, with salads or polenta&#8230;the possibilities are absolutely endless.  I am so glad I stumbled on to your post.  I can&#8217;t wait to try your beans!",
				"I made the rice and the beans and they both turned out delicious!  I added a chopped poblano pepper to the beans for additional flavor and used brown (whole grain) rice.  I really enjoyed the tomatillos in the rice &#8211; I have never cooked with them before and they brighten up the rice.  This is a very budget friendly meal that packs a ton of flavor! Thanks!",
				"OMG! It came out delicious! Great recipe!. As a Mexican and new vegan I can tell you I will be making use of this recipe a lot! Thank you"

				"1 1/2 cups (110g) vegan marshmallows, ~12 large ones, or use minis"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 5 minutes",
			"serving": "16 ~2\" square brownies",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF with a rack placed in the center. Spray a 9 inch square baking dish with oil. Cut a piece of parchment to fit the bottom with a couple extra inches to climb up the sides. Place parchment over greased dish with the overhang for easy brownie removal after baking.",

				"3. In a small pot combine the milk, yogurt and sugar. Heat over low heat, stirring regularly, until hot but not bubbling (~120 \u00baF, you don't need to check the temperature with a thermometer, it should be hot but not simmering). Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is a bit glossy. Turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate. Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the oil and the vanilla extract and stir to combine. If mixing in chocolate chips for rocky road brownies, set aside and allow the mixture to cool for 15-20 minutes so they won't melt, otherwise, skip ahead.",
				"4. Once the melted chocolate mixture is has cooled to lukewarm, add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined and no dry spots are left. If making rocky road brownies, add most of the chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, and vegan marshmallows, reserving a little of each to sprinkle on top. Gently fold them into the batter.",
				"5. Spread the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with the back of the spoon. Sprinkle on the reserved nuts, chocolate chips and a marshmallow or two (placing to fill in any marshmallow gaps). Gently press these into the top of the batter.",
				"6. Bake the brownies for 30-35 minutes, or until a tester comes out with some moist crumbs but no wet batter. Some melted chocolate may come out on the tester. Poke in a few places to be sure. If baking plain brownies without the add-ins bake for 5 less minutes, or 25-30 minutes.",
				"7. Remove the finished brownies from the oven and allow to cool. They're delicious warm, but will be easier to cut if you allow them to cool fully and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Brownies can always be reheated for a few seconds (15-30s, depending on microwave strength) to warm. Enjoy!"

				"YOU HAVE THE BEST RECIPES. i used coconut fat (coconut milk cans in the fridge) instead of yogurt &#8211; they&#8217;re in the oven now, but DAMN did the batter taste good! will report back how they are.",
				"Hi Eva,\nThanks for your reply! I did try it without dialling down the baking powder. The flavour was superb but I guess the leavening was a little too much and I ended up with a cakier brownie. I hadn\u2019t fed my starter in a few days but it must be pretty vigorous (!) so I will try 1/4 tsp less of baking powder next time and see how it goes. Maybe even just the acidity of the starter was enough to kick off some extra rising power? Anyway, it was a fun experiment and they were still delicious, just different than anticipated.\nI love using my SD discard in all sorts of things (especially waffles and pizza dough) but am just getting into applying it to cakes etc. It seems especially delicious with chocolatey things! I got the idea from King Arthur Flour website.  So smart ?\nAnd either way this brownie recipe is a keeper!",
				"Hi Eva!\nThese were amazing and I\u2019ll definitely make them again (started with plain but next time it will be the full monty!).\nHave you ever made brownies with discard from a sourdough starter?  I\u2019m thinking of trying that next time but wondering if I should dial down the baking powder a smidge (my starter is pretty active). Any thoughts? I was thinking of trying 120g of starter (and so I\u2019d be cutting 60g each of plant milk and flour from the recipe), if that helps at all.\nThanks!\n(Also, thanks again for always including grams in your baking recipes!)",
				"Can you share what brand or kind of plant-based yogurt you used? I find they can vary so much in terms of liquidity. Thank you!",

			"recipe": [
				"1. In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir to combine, then add the water. Mix with a wooden spoon to form a shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface then knead for 3-5 minutes until a soft and supple dough forms. Add more flour to the counter as necessary to prevent sticking and to get the correct texture. The final dough should be lightly tacky but not sticky. Set the dough back in the bowl, and cover. Let sit for 15 minutes for the gluten in the dough to relax.",
				"2. While the dough rests prepare a large half sheet rimmed baking dish. Pour a generous amount of olive oil (~1 tbsp) and spread it to cover the bottom.",
				"3. Divide the rested dough into 16 equal pieces, ~55g each. Roll each piece of dough out to about 7\" long. If the dough resists being rolled out, leave to rest for a couple of minutes then roll again. To roll the dough, first roll back and forth under the palm of one of your hands until it's a few inches long. Then switch to using the first two to 3 fingers of each hand and roll the dough back and forth starting with your fingers spread with pointer fingers meeting at the center of the rope and moving them outwards to the end as you roll the dough under your fingers, never fully reaching the end of the dough to prevent a pointy torpedo tip. Place your fingers back in the center and continue rolling until the dough is rolled to your desired length.",
				"4. Set the rolled breadsticks in the prepared baking tray, with about 1/2\" between each breadstick. When all the breadsticks are shaped and placed in the baking tray cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 1 hour until the dough is puffy and starting to run into each other.",
				"5. While the dough is rising, heat the oven to 450 \u00baF with a rack placed in the center. Let the oven preheat for at least 45 minutes.",
				"6. When the breadsticks have risen and the oven is hot, remove the plastic from the pan and brush the tops of the breadsticks generously with olive oil (~ 2 tsp olive oil). Sprinkle on the granulated garlic as well as a little salt over each breadstick. Place in center rack of oven and bake for 8-10 minutes until just turning a light golden color in spots.",
				"7. Enjoy the breadsticks sprinkled with a little minced parsley (if using) alongside the easy marinara dipping sauce.",
				"8. While the breadsticks are rising, make the sauce. Add the tablespoon of olive oil to a small pot. Heat over medium-low heat and when warm add the minced garlic, crushed red pepper, dried thyme, and salt. Fry for 30-60 seconds, stirring, until the garlic is just a shade golden.",
				"9. Add the can of tomatoes and turn the heat up to medium. Bring to a low boil then turn the heat down to low. Let simmer gently and uncovered for about 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes.",
				"10. When done simmering, blend with an immersion blender or traditional blender for a smoother texture (optional). Taste the sauce and add salt if needed.",

				"2. Place all cream sauce ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside.",
				"3. In a large skillet or heavy bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Prepare a plate by lining with paper towels and set next to the pan. Fry the dried sage leaves in the oil for about 15 seconds (you want to take them out before they start to turn black in spots), then remove them with a slotted spoon and place on the paper towel lined tray and sprinkle with a pinch of salt, then set aside until ready to serve. The sage leaves will splutter a little when they hit the hot oil, so be careful. If you don't want to deal with making crispy sage, just chop up the fresh sage and add it alongside the garlic and crushed red pepper.",
				"4. Turn the heat down to medium-low and using the same oil for frying the sage, add the sliced mushrooms with a pinch of salt. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the mushrooms have released their water, and are turning golden. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, and the 1/4 tsp of salt (and sage if not making crispy sage), and cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic turns golden. If needed add a teaspoon of olive oil. Turn off the heat until the pasta is done cooking.",

			"ingredients": [
				"1/2 cup (113g) cold vegan butter",
				"1 cup (120g) powdered sugar, sifted",
				"2 tbsp (30g) plant milk",
				"1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
				"1/2 tsp peppermint extract",
				"1 1/2 cups (185g) all purpose flour",
				"1/2 cup (56g) almond flour",
				"1/4 tsp (1g) salt",
				"red food coloring"
			],
			"time": "53 minutes",
			"serving": "~32 cookies",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Leave the vegan butter out to soften for about 15 minutes while you gather the rest of your ingredients. If left out longer to soften you may need to chill your dough for longer before shaping.",
				"2. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF with a rack positioned in the middle and prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with parchment and set aside.",
				"3. In a large mixing bowl or a stand mixer, add the vegan butter, the sifted powdered sugar, the plant milk, the vanilla extract, and peppermint extract. Beat on low until the powdered sugar is incorporated, then turn speed up to medium in a stand mixer or high on a handheld beater until the mixture is creamed and fluffy.",
				"4. In a second mixing bowl whisk together the all purpose flour, almond flour, and salt until combined.",
				"5. Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on low until incorporated. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and beat on low until combined and a smooth dough is formed.",
				"6. Take half of the dough and transfer it to the second mixing bowl. You can weigh the dough to divide it so as not to end up with extra dough of one color at the end. Add red food coloring to half the dough and mix it in with the handheld or stand mixer to incorporate, adding more if necessary until you get your desired color and saturation.",
				"7. Place both mixing bowls in the freezer and let chill for 15 minutes so that the cookies are easier to shape.",
				"8. Once the dough is firm enough to easily handle, shape the cookies. Take 1 tsp of each color and roll into matching ~4\" ropes. Place the strands next to each other and twist. Transfer the twisted rope to the prepared baking tray and fold down the top third to create a hook. Repeat with the remaining dough to fill the baking tray, leaving ~1 1/2 inches between each cookie, as they won't spread much. I like to shape half of them hooking to the right and the other half to the left, but this is personal preference. Shape your second batch of cookies while the first are baking. At any point, if the dough is warming up and gets more challenging to shape, you can place it back in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to firm up again.",
				"9. Bake the tray of cookies on the center rack for 7-9 minutes, or until the bottom and edges take on the faintest shade of golden. Time can vary depending on your oven, so keep a close eye on them in the last few minutes of baking. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking tray, then gently transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Follow the same instructions for the second tray of cookies.",
				"10. Note: You can prepare your dough in advance and wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator until ready to shape and bake cookies. You can also bake both trays of cookies at the same time with one oven rack set one place up from the middle and a second rack one spot lower. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking.",
				"11. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container, I actually find that they taste better after the first day!"

			"title": "Creamy Broccoli Cauliflower Soup with Potato Dumplings and Crispy Vegan Bacon",

				"3oz/85g baked Yukon gold potato (~3/4 cups unpacked riced potato, or a scant \u00bd cup packed mashed potato)",
				"\u00bd cup (65g) all purpose flour",
				"1/8 tsp salt",

				"1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice",
				"2 500mL cartons of Fawen Broccoli & Cauliflower with Turmeric Soup",
				"1 5.5oz package of Sweet Earth Foods Benevolent Bacon",
				"1 tbsp oil"
			],
			"time": "30 minutes",
			"serving": "2-3 servings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. First cook the potato in the microwave. Wash and dry the potato, then pierce it in several places with a fork to allow steam to escape while it cooks. Wrap the potato loosely in a paper towel, then microwave on high for about 4 minutes. Time can vary depending on your microwave and the size and shape of the potato. The potato is done when the insides are completely soft and no resistance is met when piercing with a fork. Let the potato cool until you can handle it, and then peel off the skin (it should easily rub off under your fingers, but you can use the edge of a spoon to assist). If using a potato ricer, you can skip the peeling step and cut the potato in half and place cut side down on the ricer, the ricer will separate the flesh from the peel and you can discard the peel after pressing. If you do not wish to use the microwave, you can bake the potato in the oven, but this will take a lot longer.",
				"2. While the potatoes cook make the pistou. In a small food processor, pulse the garlic to mince it. Then add the washed basil and salt and process to finely chop the basil. Add the olive oil and process to combine to your desired texture. Add the lemon juice and pulse to distribute. Taste and adjust the flavor if desired.",
				"3. At this point your potatoes should be done cooking. While they cool for a couple of minutes, pour 2 cartons of Fawen Broccoli & Sweet Potato Soup into a large pot. Cover and bring the soup to a low boil over medium-high heat.",
				"4. Meanwhile, make the dumpling dough. For the best results, send the cooked potato through a potato ricer into a large mixing bowl. Otherwise mash the potato with a potato masher or a fork until fairly smooth. This second method will leave small lumps of potato in your final dumpling, but that\u2019s ok, it will still be delicious. Sprinkle the flour, salt, and olive oil over the riced or mashed potato. Using your fingers crumble the potato and distribute throughout the mixture. The mixture will begin to form small crumbles. When you have an even looking pebbly mixture start squeezing handfuls of the dumpling dough in your hand as a way to knead the mixture into a cohesive mass. Continue until you form a smooth dough. If the dough feels dry, drizzle in additional olive oil. If the dough feels wet and at all sticky, sprinkle on more flour. Form the dough into 1 tsp sized dumplings. You should make around 16-18 dumplings.",
				"5. When the soup reaches a low boil, add the dumplings to the soup. Let cook for around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally so they don\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot. The dumplings will float to the top in about 4 minutes, and then let them cook about 1 additional minute before turning off the heat. Leave the pot covered to keep warm.",
				"6. While the dumplings are cooking, you can fry up the seitan bacon. Heat a large non-stick (such as cast iron) skillet over medium low heat. Add the oil when hot so that a thin film covers the entire pan. You can use less oil, for a less crispy result. Lay down a single layer of Sweet Earth Foods Benevolent Bacon and fry about 4 minutes, flipping every minute, or until the seitan bacon is a shade or two darker and the edges are a little black. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any extra oil, then chop or tear into small pieces.",
				"7. To serve, Divide soup between 2 bowls, spoon some pistou over the soup, and sprinkle on the torn seitan bacon. Add crushed red pepper or freshly ground black pepper as desired and enjoy your easy and delicious gourmet meal!"

I stuck pretty much to the recipe, \u2014 increased all the spices a bit (other than the cayenne pepper), put more peas in it, and while it was all cooking together added another can of tomatoes to the pot (so it definitely needed more salt).\nLoved the recipe, keep \u2018em coming!\n&#8211; Jack, Arlington VA",

The sauce was too thick to blend so I added another can of coconut milk and it was delicious and creamy \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb I tripled the tofu also because we love tofu in this family. I love that these recipes always make 6 servings so my husband and I can get three meals out of them!",

I made two changes, I added one tablespoon of lemon juice at the beginning instead of the sliced lemons, and I added the kale just 5-7 minutes before the cooking time was done so it maintained its bright green color .  The flavors were great, this will be lunch for me for a few days this week.",
				"Maybe I cut my lemons too thin because they completely disintegrated and my dish was so bitter I could barely eat it.  I used brown rice so I cooked it longer so maybe that played a role as well.  I added steamed broccoli instead of kale and that was good.  Will try again with thicker slices lemon and maybe fewer as well.",

				"1 tsp (3 g) sea salt",
				"1 tbsp (15 g) extra virgin olive oil",
				"1 tsp (2 g) freshly ground black pepper"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 5 minutes",
			"serving": "~4 servings",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Add flour, salt, and black pepper into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the oil and aquafaba and turn the food processor on and run until the mixture forms into a ball. In my food processor this takes around 90 seconds. Keep running another 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead for 1 minute to check the final texture of the dough. You want a firm, but still pliable dough that is not sticky or tacky to the touch.",
				"2. Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand: mix the flour, salt, and black pepper together. Add the oil and aquafaba and mix with a wooden spoon to form a shaggy, but rather dry mixture. Turn the mixture onto a clean counter and switch to your hands. Knead the dough until it forms a cohesive ball. If it is very dry then wet your hands and continue kneading. It will take 4-5 minutes to form a cohesive ball of dough. Let the dough rest, covered, for around 10 minutes to hydrate the flour, then knead a couple more minutes to check that it's the correct texture. The dough should be firm and not sticky or tacky, but still be pliable.",
				"3. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes. If resting more than 1 hour, place in fridge. The dough can be made up to 24 hours before rolling.",
				"4. When ready to roll the dough, divide into 3 or 4 portions (if this is your first time working with pasta dough separate into 4 portions, but as you get more confident 3 makes it go faster). Work with one piece of dough at a time, and keep the others wrapped tightly in plastic so they don't dry out.",
				"5. Roll the section of dough with a rolling pin until it's long and rectangular and around 1/4\" thin. Then take that strip of dough and feed it through a pasta roller at the thickest setting. Run it through that setting at least 3 times, until it runs through easily and is no longer pressing the dough. Then, turn the knob so that the pasta roller is one setting thinner. Repeat the process of running the dough through the roller around 3 times until it's not getting pressed. Set the roller one setting thinner and repeat once more.",
				"6. Take the dough and place it on the counter. Fold the sides of the dough into the center to meet. Then fold in half. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough in the opposite direction of the fold to create a neat rectangle. Then, repeat the process of running the dough through the thickest three settings of the pasta roller, starting with the thickest setting and running through a couple of times before turning to the thinner setting and so on. Run the dough with the thinner side going in first and rolling down the wider side, this is the opposite direction you were rolling the dough previously.",
				"7. Repeat the folding of the dough on the counter, and rolling perpendicular to the fold once more. Now feed the dough through the machine on the thickest setting once more, and work one setting at a time until you get to the 4th or 3rd from the thinnest setting. For linguini or fettuccini I prefer leaving my noodles a bit thicker and typically go for the 4th setting. For making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini I go to the 3rd or maybe even 2nd thinnest setting, as the edges get doubled up on.",
				"8. Lay the finished sheet of pasta on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with a towel.",
				"9. Repeat this process with the remaining sections of dough. It should go fairy quickly once you have the hang of it.",
				"10. Once you have your sheets of dough, dust them with some flour and cut into the desired shapes. You can use a machine to cut into spaghetti or thicker noodles like linguini, or you can cut by hand to whatever width you desire. Toss the noodles in more flour if they are at all sticky. Cover until ready to cook. You can cook immediately or leave the noodles out to dry for an hour before cooking. You can flour the somewhat dried noodles well before transferring to a sealed container and putting in the fridge for a few hours or a day before cooking. If waiting longer than a day, place in the freezer.",
				"11. To cook the noodles, bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the noodles to the pot and cook for 1-2 minutes. Depending on the size of the noodles you may need less time, such as if you make spaghetti. Begin checking for doneness after 30 seconds. Be careful, the noodles can go from done to over cooked quickly. For my linguini style of noodles 90 seconds seems to work perfectly.",
				"12. Drain the noodles and toss in your favorite pasta sauce, or with some olive oil and vegan parmesan cheese. Taste before adding salt, as the noodles might not need any more. Enjoy!"

				"Added more salt and pepper for more depth. Kids loved it with just olive oil. Will make again.",
				"This turned out brilliantly. I left out the pepper because I was making ravioli and wanted a blank canvas. Am toying with the idea of steeping some turmeric in the aquafaba to give the pasta more of a yellow color. This recipe made 36 ravioli. The texture of the dough both when rolling and after its cooked is absolutely gorgeous! Just the right amount of toothsome. Hopefully nothing crazy happens in the freezer. Thanks for sharing!",
				"Hey&#8230;. I have made pasta a few times and always intend to make a batch extra to dry out and use later. When i make the dough just with water and dry it out its great till about even two months. But will using aquafaba also enable me to dry out the pasta and use it later? and what will be the approximate life in such case?",
				"My previous comment meant to say Cacio e pepe.  Auto correct made it almost unreadable, sorry.  And thanks for the recipe.",

I won&#8217;t post the link so I don&#8217;t look like I&#8217;m trying to promote a bother site, but there is a decent recipe for vegan cacao e pepe out on the web from New York Times.  Subbing dry pasta for this pasta is going to make for a delicious vegan pasta dish.",
				"How would using semolina flour change the recipe? Also, what kind of flavor does the pasta take on using chickpea aquafaba? Thanks!",
				"Do you think this is possible using chickpea flour and no oil?",
				"I did use a food processor the first time. \nI made some again yesterday with a pasta roller and it was great! I did add an extra half tablespoon of olive oil anyway just in case and it was wonderful. \nNow I just need to get something to make the ravioli making process easier lol.",
				"Thank you! Made this as ravioli on Friday for World Pasta Day and it turned out fantastic! I&#8217;m omni and my partner is vegetarian and we try and incorporate vegan as much as possible into our diet. \nI&#8217;d never made pasta at home before and I decided since I&#8217;d never learnt how to make it might as well try and learn to make a good vegan pasta! I&#8217;m omni and my partner is vegetarian and we try and incorporate vegan as much as possible into our diet.\nMost recipes online I saw looked quite bland so I decided to give this one a go since you really seemed to know what you&#8217;re talking about and the cracked pepper looked very nice! \nI hand rolled my pasta, hoping to soon buy a pasta machine, and it worked really well! I couldn&#8217;t roll it out as thin as I liked but that was too be expected.\nThe one thing I may change when I make this again is to add more oil as I noticed the dough got quite dry and tougher to work with as I shaped the ravioli. I&#8217;m sure that wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if I was just making fettuccine. \nAs for another comment saying the pasta was chewy, I agree but it may be because my pasta was just thicker to begin with and also double up on the ravioli edge. But I really loved the texture!",
				"I just made this tonight and ermergerd! So good. I used 1/2 semolina and 1/2 AP but didn\u2019t reduce the aquafaba. I took a piece of pasta to check fineness and it was *buttery* and delicious. Thank you!",
				"I was wondering if I could use the same recipe with spelt flour?",
				"I became interested in this recipe because my child has an egg allergy.. I have found since that she can actually eat egg yolks but not the whites, I plan to make this recipe but  substitute the whites with aquafaba (I&#8217;ll keep the yolks in).",

				"Should I be allowing the reduced aquafaba to cool before making the dough? Or am I ok to use it straight from the saucepan while it\u2019s hot?",
				"I made the pasta perfectly and all was well!\nBut then after cooking the pasta it was mushy and didn\u2019t seem cooked! Tried varying cooking times but didn\u2019t seem to change anything!\nAny ideas?",
				"Last year I used this recipe for fresh tortellini and it worked brilliantly. I\u2019m about to use it again for ravioli. Thanks for sharing. I do use a food processor because it does a better job of getting things mixed evenly and I use a pasta roller. I cannot and would not roll by hand! It would take too long and it would dry out. Thank you. I just tried to give you 5 stars but think I might have given you less so if I have apologies!",
				"I followed this recipe to  the letter and was only able to make noodles with about 1/4 of the pasta dough. The rest of it either crumbled  and fell apart as I rolled it out or or was too hard and unable to roll out after resting in the fridge. I tried to moisten my hands when rolling the rested dough out but it didn\u2019t help much &#8211; the dough just got sticky and I had to add more flour. What could have gone wrong? What can I do differently next time? Should I add more liquid or oil next time? The few noodles that I was able to roll out we\u2019re delicious, though.",
				"Is it possible to use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose?",
				"this does not take 12 minutes",
				"Thanks for this recipe! I\u2019m wondering if the process would be the same is using a gluten free flour mix? My husband is unfortunately gluten free as well as egg free, and finding a recipe that works for fresh pasta dough has been nearly impossible.",
				"I just made a 1/4 batch following your recipe and I am making these for use as cannelloni.\nI rolled out by hand after letting the mixed dough relax for about a half and hour.\nRolling by had is a lot of work but what I noticed is that after making the folds the dough did not want to roll out thin anymore so I figured letting it rest again might help. Another rest of half an hour seemed to help, though it was still pretty tough to get it thin. I am happy with the result and have under cooked them to start with because they will cook more when they are filled and covered with sauce.  I am no pasta expert but they seem a little tough (maybe because I undercooked them) but I think they will be fine for my use.\nThank you for posting the recipe."

				"Hello Chickpea,it&#8217;s me again. Just wanted to let you know that we had this the other night, with a spin. Not being equipped to bake a proper pizza crust, I made a coconut oil puff pastry and turned your creation into a tarted fine! It was yummy.\nThe thinly sliced eggplant and multiple baking trays made this a bit of a labor of love,but the seasonings are so perfect it was worth it!\nKeep up the good work, we&#8217;re lovin&#8217; it."

				"This was absolutely amazing. I only made one change which was to switch the seitan to tofu as I live in a tiny remote town with only one grocery store that didn&#8217;t have it. However tasted brilliant. Although next time I make it I&#8217;m going to skip the lime juice as the sauce tasted better before I added it, although it might need it for the flavour when steaming. Def will. Make many times in the future \ud83d\ude00"

For this, is the paprika what gives it its smokiness or is it the chipotle pepper? I just recently made a smokey cheesy dip, but I used liquid smoke to give it that smoky smell and taste. I&#8217;m wondering if I could replace it with a little smoked paprika instead. You&#8217;re inspiring me to try more smoky variations!\nThank you!"

				"2. In a large mixing bowl add the flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and stir to combine with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough is formed.",
				"3. Turn the dough out onto a clean and floured counter. Knead for ~2 minutes, adding more flour as necessary to create a lightly tacky (but not sticky) dough. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to give the flour a chance to hydrate and the gluten to relax, then knead an additional 3 minutes until you have a relatively smooth and very lightly tacky ball of dough. Place the dough into a large, oiled mixing bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until about double in size. *During this time, you can prepare the custard.",

Knead the scraps of dough together gently to reform a cohesive dough, then roll again to cut, repeating as necessary to shape all the dough. Place the cut rounds onto a lightly floured baking tray and sprinkle some flour over the tops. Lightly cover with some plastic wrap or a towel and set aside to proof an additional 20 minutes.",

To shape the bagels you can either (a) poke a hole in the middle of the dough ball and gently stretch the hole until it's an inch or two wide or (b) roll until 8-10\" long then wrap around your hand and roll the two ends under your palm to seal [see photos in post for visuals]. Place shaped bagels on the greased baking sheet. When all are shaped spray with more oil and then cover with plastic wrap. Place in fridge and leave overnight, or up to 48 hours.",
				"5. On baking day: test dough to determine if it's fully proofed by placing it in a bowl of water. If it floats it's ready to go, if not, leave it out on the counter to finish rising at room temperature, retesting regularly until ready.",
				"6. Preheat the oven to 500 \u00baF.",

Boil the bagels 2-3 at a time, taking care not to over crowd the pot, for 60 seconds then flip and boil an additional 45-60 seconds. Strain and place bagels back on the baking sheet. Top with your desired toppings while they're still hot and wet for optimal sticking. If using seeds, gently press them into the dough after topping. Repeat with remaining bagels.",
				"9. When the oven is pre-heated and bagels are all boiled and toppings added, place the baking sheet into the oven on the center rack and turn the heat down to 450 \u00baF. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet and bake an additional 8-10 minutes until the bagels are a dark golden brown. If you didn't use barley malt syrup in the poaching liquid, they will not brown as darkly or richly.",

				"This is my go-to recipe for bagels. I love them and so does everybody who has tried them.",
				"This was my second attempt at bagels and the first time following this recipe. I weighed the ingredients and loosely followed the instructions &#8211; I kneaded the dough longer than instructed and followed a different boiling recipe. The oven temps and times were off, the bagels didn&#8217;t rise well and the golden color was really difficult to achieve. This adaptation needs work, I appreciate the author&#8217;s feedback in other comments but it seems this recipe is still a work in progress. I won&#8217;t use this recipe again, I&#8217;m sorry to say.",
				"I tried this recipe because it included instructions for a food processor. I misread the recipe and used 1.5 cups of water which seemed fine. Just out of the oven.   Taste great.   Next time I would make 10-12 bagels as they are rather large.",
				"I\u2019ve made these 3 times, doubling the last 2 batches, and the last batch was on point. My dough puffs up in the fridge then collapses with the slightest manipulation, so I reshaped the entire batch, and let it rest another 20 minutes, and boiled them, they puffed up beautifully, and puffed up even more during the bake. I am liberal with the olive oil I use to prevent drying out or sticking to the parchment paper, and I use the same parchment paper throughout and for the bake, the bagels sort of fry a little in the olive oil, which adds a wonderful crunch and a whole new wonderful dimension to these already great great bagels.",
				"This is the recipe/blog-post that keeps on giving, isn&#8217;t it?\nI&#8217;m born and raised in the New York metropolitan area and have eaten dozens and dozens of NY bagels. I worked in a bagel store for most of a school year, a very long time ago, when I was 16, bagging and making sandwiches &#8211; not baking.\nNow living in the Boston area where there are bagels but they&#8217;re not the same. My brother lived here for a while: he accurately described the local bagels as &#8220;rolls.&#8221;\nI followed the recipe, scaling up 150% so that I&#8217;d get a dozen, with two days in the fridge before baking, using a scale to measure, and malt syrup that was available at Whole Foods.  Used bread flour from Lindley Mills (purchased 25 pounds when bread flour was scarce at the beginning of the pandemic).  This dozen, the first I&#8217;ve ever made, included two everything, four onion, and six sesame.  Had a bite while still warm last night and then toasted, straight out of the freezer, this morning for breakfast. Perfect!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! I expect that I&#8217;ll be making these again.",
				"This is a great recipe, as long as I immediately put the dough in the fridge overnight for the first rise in the fridge, and barely do any second rise at all in the morning (just enough time to form the bagels and boil the water/heat the oven). Otherwise they overproof and fall when I boil them, but the \u201creverse\u201d way has worked perfectly for me.",
				"I&#8217;m still confused by the first two steps:\ncombine ingredients in a food processor, let rest for 10 min\nThen Add dry ingredients and wet together in a stand mixer.\nIsn&#8217;t it just take dough from food processor and move to stand mixer or table?",
				"I\u2019ve made these bagels twice now. The first time I didn\u2019t time things well and forgot to preheat the oven, so I think they sat out too long and ended up completely flat (although tasted delicious). I tried for the 2nd time today and while some turned out better, some were still pretty flat. I\u2019m not sure what part of the process I need to improve on? Again, they taste perfect, but just hoping for a higher bagel.  Thanks!",
				"FYI &#8211; a cup of water weighs 236.588 grams.  1 1/3 or 1.33 cups of water weigh 315g, not 350g as the recipe calls for. 350g/236.588g=1.48 cups of water. This really points to the problem with volume measurements.",
				"To follow up, for measuring small amounts a jewlers scale works well, ~$12 on Amazon. Mine measures to a 100th of a gram, granted a bit overkill.",
				"These are very good bagels. \nFor those the have trouble finding bread flour you can use vital wheat gluten(VWG), VTW can be found in most chain grocery stores. This makes it possible to have excellent results with AP flour. I even use it with bread flour since it&#8217;s my opinion bagels work even better with high gulten flour which runs around 14.2% protein. Bread four runs around 12-13%, AP around 10-11%. The formula for caculating how much VWG you need is as follows, make sure you use paretheses as shown: ((target protein percent) &#8211; (source flour protein percent))*(flour amount)/(VWG protein percent &#8211; source flour protein percent).\nIf you want to be very precise take total flour minus the amount of VWG",
				"The dough was very hard to handle after letting the dough proof in the fridge and taking it out  to prepare for the boil.  It is so soft and lost its shape when I picked it up to place in the pot.  I had to reshape them to help firm them up  and wait 10 more mins for another light proofing before boiling.   This was the only way to keep the shape.  Handling it after a long proof is impossible, what am I missing here?",
				"They were delicious !!\nCan they be made into a loaf and baked as bread ?",
				"Hi so I made these for the first time and followed the recipe exactly. I got a pretty stiff dough but my bagels turned out just a little flat. They weren\u2019t like really really flat but just a little. What should I change to make them a little puffier?",

				"I followed your recipe.  They didn\u2019t rise as much as I would like.  They did rise more than another recipe I used.  Any suggestions   I let the yeast foam to be sure it was good. Then I mixed it with the flour and salt",
				"hi! i&#8217;ve been trying different bagel recipes for the last week and they were all just slightly off &#8211; not chewy enough, no crust formed, weird ratios &#8211; but this one worked flawlessly first try, and it was so easy! thanks so much!",

				"So I tripled the dough because I&#8217;m making minis for a baby shower (51-52 gr each).\nGoal was to boil and freeze to bake off the day of the shower but I did a test run on 3 for baking.  Used a pizza stone at 450 with and without a pan of water.  We decided that those baked with the water were less crisp so I will be ditching the water for the final baking.  I noticed that  https://food.briess.com/  recipe uses 2 types of syrup and AP rather than bread flour.  I would not change the flour but have come to the conclusion that what is missing from most other bagels is the complexity of flavor from the malt syrup so I&#8217;d like to try some combinations, and also try and completely replace the yeast with sourdough starter as the long rise/sourdough/syrups all appear  to impact the complexity of the flavor.  Will be searching for starter/kg flour ratios&#8230;. great bagels and I think there will be the hit of the shower!",
				"So, I added a bit of sour dough starter and am doing the overnight proof now.  I think it is important to mention that this can be done first because I am tripling the recipe and would not have room for the formed bagels overnight.  My Kitchenaid did fine with the dough.  I am making mini bagels as I am helping out with a baby shower and no local place- we are looking at a 15 mile radius, makes minis.   \nI plan on freezing partially baked bagels an finishing them the day of the event for a fresh taste.  Any suggestions as to how long I should bake them?\nI do have a stone insert I can use in my oven.  did the pan with water go in under the stone?  I get that is for getting an extra crisp outer dough as one would do for a baguette.  \nany suggestion as to the weight of dough I should be using for a mini bagel?\nThanks!",

				"I haven&#8217;t tried this recipe yet, but it looks like it will do right nice by a New York bagel.  But my question is that I&#8217;ve since moved to northern New Mexico where the elevation is almost 7000 feet.  Is there something I need to do differently to make the bagels work?\nThank you",
				"I&#8217;ve been thinking about making bagels for a week now!  My mixer is broken, so looked for a recipe where I could use my food processor instead.  I made what I might call a PERFECT batch of bagels!  Very excited to have found this.   I did find the dough a little bit dry, so just wetted it a tiny bit when kneading, but I&#8217;ve found this is a common thing with bread-baking.  The only thing I might do next time is make 10 bagels instead of 8.   They are HUGE!  I can&#8217;t wait to try other toppings, only  used sesame seeds this time.  Thank you so much!",
				"Try an egg wash of egg yolk, cream and a dash of salt. My toppings stick like crazy.",
				"OMG! I just made my first batch of homemade bagels and they are awesome! Followed the  recipe to a T although I did use an egg wash which allowed the poppyseed and everything toppings to adhere very well. Used King Arthur bread flour.  As a native New Yorker now living on the West Coast, I can say that these are the best bagels I\u2019ve eaten in a long time.",
				"The flavor is definitely there.  It was so good, my daughter and I were eating raw dough.  I had a huge amount of trouble getting the dough to come together, however.  Ended up using over 1/3 cups more water than the recipe called for, and it was still an extremely dry dough that barely came together, which affected the rise.  I ended up using longer rise as well to compensate for this.  Next time, I think I will go with my feel instead of worrying overly much about what the recipe calls for.  There will be a next time, because the end result is just so good.",
				"I made these using the recipe as is but I used a scale to weigh out all the ingredients &#8211; worked perfectly.  I used diastatic malt powder and a little honey in the poaching liquid because I could not find any malt syrup.  I also used Everything but the Bagel seasoning blend from Trader Joe &#8211; made the topping process a bit easier.. Thanks!",
				"Thank you for this superb recipe that encapsulates so many important points regarding bagel making. After repeated disappointment with store bought which are little more that donut shaped Wonder bread or overpriced and usually only OK bagel shop bagels, I have gone all in on home baking. . \nI just tried it and agree that adding baking soda and salt in addition to malt syrup to the boil gets the perfect crunchy but thin crust. I had a few suggestions about which perhaps other readers can comment:\n1) Since bagels have a bit in common with pizza dough in terms of preparation and ingredients, I have substituted 100g of ripe sourdough starter for 80g of the water, since sourdoughs develop well with long, cool retards. You can cut the instant yeast a bit if you add sourdough\n2) I have had good luck with Korean rice syrup (ssalyeot) that also has a high maltose content. Maltose has a distinct taste unlike sucrose (sugar), melibiose (honey) and most other sweeteners or syrups, and does not contain any fructose. These are available inexpensively at Korean markets in LA or in general at Asian markets or on Amazon.\n3) Most baking flours contain malt that includes enzymes that break down starch into sugars, improving yeast action and rise. You can overdo it with diastatic powder but 1/2 tsp seems to work well. Please understand that non-diastatic syrup or powder is for flavor whereas diastatic powder contains enzymes. You can purchase a decade&#8217;s worth of diastatic malt powder (1.5 lb.) on Amazon for ~$10. Malt powder is also great for baiting mouse traps!\n4) Flour is key to all baking. For bagels, I prefer General Mills All-Trumps that has 14.2% protein, which is higher than bread flours. The protein is important to get the right &#8216;chew&#8217;. Some of the other strong flours such as KA Sir Lancelot are almost as good.\n5) If you regularly make bagels, the stiff, low-hydration dough will overtax most home mixers. I have had good luck with the Swedish Ankarsrum which was able to\n6) The flour:water ratio varies according to flour type and humidity. For bagels, you want a smooth and elastic dough that is barely sticky. Adjust with small amounts of flour or water accordingly.\n7) Silicone mats work great and avoid any use of oil. For the overnight retard, simply cover the bagels with plastic wrap that will adhere to the mat around the bagels, forming a seal.\n8) I bake at 475\u00b0 with a stone on the bottom and a pan. I allow about 45 min to fully heat the stones and the oven. I pour boiling water into the pan just before closing the oven door.",
				"Can active dry yeast be used instead of instant yeast?",
				"Wow! Nice Bagels. one of my favorite dish. Will try it soon.",
				"I have been looking at many bagel recipes and a few people have used brown sugar instead of the malt barley. What is your thought on this? Will it give a different flavor? Not taste like a real bagel should?",
				"I had all but given up on having great bagels, after moving away from North Jersey 25 years ago.  These are the best I have EVER had.",
				"These came out beautifully, in spite of some discrepancies on my part: I had no bread flour so had to use AP;, and my husband didn&#8217;t hear me tell him to turn the oven down before popping them in, so they baked the whole time at 500. Still they were chewy and crunchy and tender and dark golden brown and couldn&#8217;t be better.\nI was a bit worried because the dough seemed so dry to work with, but your reassurance about the percentage of hydration helped, and I took a leap of faith. This will be on my regular go-to list of recipes forever! Thanks.",
				"Hi again, well as you may have guessed my next batch came out exactly as you\u2019ve experienced with a wetter dough\u2014-FLAT!  They did puff up nicely in the fridge but were impossible to handle &amp; will be like bagel chips once cut.  Thanks so much for your time on the recipe &amp; your responses.",
				"Hi Eva, thanks for the really quick reply\u2014just wish I had read it before starting my next batch!  I\u2019ve tried weighing my ingredients when making pizza dough but even though I have a high quality scale it never seems to come out right either., at least when I use grams.  I\u2019m using King Arthur Bread Flour but did NOT do as you suggested &amp; whisk it first.  I wound up having to add more than 1 additional cup of water (added a little more barley syrup along with it).  Even with having to change on the fly, the bagels still came out very close to the bagels I used to get on Long Island in terms of texture, size &amp; flavor &amp; definitely so much batter than any supposed \u2018NY bagel\u2019 I can get here near Tampa.  Everyone wolfed them down &amp; even passed over my raisin bread in favor of these bagels!  Thanks again.",
				"Now I\u2019m having the opposite problem\u2014going strictly by the recipe, 1 1/3 c water is not nearly enough.  I came across your recipe searching for a bagel recipe like the bagels I used to get when I lived on Long Island.  Once I added about 1/2 c or more of water the dough was better but still seemed too dry. I thinks \u2018savs\u2019 comment from Dec. 29 hits it about right, though even with dough that wasn\u2019t nearly hydrated enough these turned out as close to the bagels I was looking for as I\u2019ve found since moving to FL.  It was so hard to resist not eating a hot onion bagel when they were done at 9pm, simply not fair.",
				"I\u2019m an amateur baker and I\u2019ve been making Peter Reinhart\u2019s bagels from \u201cThe Bread Baker\u2019s Apprentice\u201d for about 2 years and have always had mixed results, mostly because of the bagels flattening out. They always tasted ok but we\u2019re never the right shape.  I was so excited to read your explanation on hydration in the recipe as it answered that question, I\u2019ve done this recipe twice now and they\u2019ve been more consistent. My one problem is getting the toppings to stick to the bagel. I use both malt and baking soda in the poaching liquid, but once they\u2019re through baking, and light handling to slice them, knocks 85% of the toppings off. I put on poppy seeds, sesame seeds, salt, onion, and garlic.",
				"The right way to make it is use soggy bagel dough and let rest for two days in the frig. It&#8217;s the two day bagel whe dough needs to mature to taste like a classic bagel. I never flour the table I want the dough wet unlike pizza dough which I throw into the AP flour to roll out. For bagels you roll the dough into balls and then cylinders to length then connect the ends into a loop. Then put three fingers into the hole roll once back and forth to meld the seam together. Place into a pot of boiling water boil on both sides 45 seconds to 1 min. They must float upto the surface or they won&#8217;t be airy after baking. Then place on wooden plakes to dry off one side then place them on to it&#8217;s other side on sheet pans till golden. These steps don&#8217;t include the sprinkle toppings such seasame , garlic etc. Cut and smear on some cream cheese or butter. You should hear the crunch when you bite down and the inside should be airy and moist. I may have missed a few things but keep looking.",

Using a pastry cutter, or two butter knives in opposition, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks pebbly. Some larger pieces of butter should remain. Add the crumbled or shredded cheese and mix in with a wooden spoon.",

It's not going to be perfectly formed dough at this point, the folding will help it come together. Reach under one side of the dough and fold it in half. Fold it again in the opposite direction. Press or roll the dough into a rectangle once more, and repeat the two folds.

				"6. Using a 2 1/2 - 3\" biscuit or round cutter, cut the dough into rounds, pressing down but DO NOT TWIST. Twisting will seal the edges and prevent the biscuits from reaching their full height potential. Once you've cut all you can from that rectangle, reform the dough into another rectangle and cut again. Repeat as necessary. The last biscuits probably will not be as beautiful, but they will be as tasty!",

Then turn back on low and let knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead for 1 minute adding flour or water if necessary. The dough should be lightly tacky but not sticky, if too sticky add more flour and if not at all tacky wet your hands and knead the water into the dough.",

Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 3-4 minutes. In the last minute of kneading add water or flour as necessary to create a lightly tacky but not sticky dough.",

Working gently to deflate as little as possible, form the dough into balls by forming a rough round shape. On a clean surface, with the seam side facing down, cup your hand over the ball of dough and make a small circular motion.

				"That&#8217;s what I meant that my cups were kind of wrong hahaha, you&#8217;re so kind for taking the time to respond, I&#8217;m definitely trying this recipe again as I liked the taste and color so much!!!your recipes makes vegan cooking so simple and tasty ?",
				"Thanks for your response!! I think is something wrong with my measuring cups because that&#8217;s how much milk I added!! Anyway, I baked them and for the first time trying pretzel buns at least they turned out brown!! And good taste as well, but definitely gonna try it again! Thanks for so many amazing recipes, so far the tahini cookies and apples and blueberries crumble muffins are my favorites!!!!! Love your blog xxx",
				"These were so delicious Eva! I ate them with some homemade burgers! You are the bread queen! Thanks for sharing the recipe I am 100% making these again soon! \ud83d\ude42",
				"Hi there, I&#8217;m new with this vegan baking and I tried this recipe yesterday but it seemed to be a lot of flour for just a cup an \u00b3/\u2074 of liquid. The dough ended up very dense and I could not integrate all the flour, please tell me what I did wrong I&#8217;m super excited to try it again, kisses!",
				"These look great! I&#8217;ve been wanting to get into baking breads but I&#8217;ve actually never made any before, or I think I tried once and it didn&#8217;t work out because the yeast was too old or something! I should probably learn more about this whole baking chemistry thing, hahah&#8230;instead of just throwing a bunch of stuff together and hoping it works it out. That leads to A LOT of failed recipes. I&#8217;m not gluten-free but I don&#8217;t eat much, however for some reason making my own bread just sounds better than going store-bought. Totally healthier, right?! \ud83d\ude09 I&#8217;ll let you know if I can successfully make these&#8230;.the instructions are very clear so I should be good to go! Thanks!"

			"title": "Stuffed Mediterranean Veggie Burgers with Greek Marinated Tomatoes",

				"1 small eggplant",

				"8 oz baby bella mushrooms, washed and sliced",

				"almond cheese",
				"12 oz ripe tomatoes, diced",
				"1-2 small shallots, minced",
				"1-2 cloves garlic, minced",
				"3 tbsp olive oil",
				"2 tbsp red wine vinegar",
				"1/4-1/2 tsp of salt, to taste",
				"lots of freshly ground black pepper"
			],
			"time": "1 hour 45 minutes",
			"serving": "15 burgers",
			"recipe": [
				"1. Cook the eggplant: Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF. Prick the eggplant all over with a knife so that steam can vent. Roast the eggplant for ~1 hour, rotating about every 20 minutes, until the eggplant is soft and no resistance is met when pricked with a knife. Set aside to cool, cutting in half will speed the process.",
				"2. While the eggplant is roasting, cook the barley. Combine the barley and 1/2 tsp of salt in a pot and cover with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes until the barley is chewy but cooked through. When done, drain and set aside.",
				"3. Warm a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and shallots, and cook until softened and golden, ~3-5 minutes. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt and lower heat to medium-low. Cook until golden and caramelized, ~6-9 minutes. Add the thyme and oregano and cook for 1 minute. Then deglaze the plan by adding the red wine vinegar to loosen the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Immediately transfer to a food processor.",
				"4. Add the chickpeas (reserving ~1/2 cup of them), 1/2 cup of the roasted eggplant (use the rest for another purpose), the cooked barley, chopped sun dried tomato, garlic, and 1 tsp of salt to the food processor and pulse to combine. When the mixture is mashed and clumping together, taste and adjust seasoning if desired. Then add the remaining 1/2 cup of chickpeas and the vital wheat gluten and pulse to combine. Due to the gluten, the mixture will probably form one large clump.",
				"5. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF to precook the burgers.",
				"6. To assemble the burgers, take 1/3 cup of mixture and form a bowl with it in your hands, add a teaspoon of cheese into the center of the bowl and gently fold the burger mixture to cover. Pat into a 3 - 3 1/2\" round (use a ring mold or cookie cutter for a clean edge). Don't stress if cheese pokes through the sides.",
				"7. Place assembled burgers onto a parchment lined, oiled baking sheet and bake at 375 \u00baF for 10-12 minutes on each side. At this point you can eat them, but they're even better the next day, grilling or frying on a skillet to warm and brown!",
				"8. Combine tomatoes, shallots, and garlic into a small bowl. Add the olive oil, red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp of salt, and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and gently stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if desired. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours before using.",
				"9. Serve the burgers with the marinated tomatoes and your choice of burger toppings, such as: avocado, mayo, vegan cheese, lettuce, or caramelized onion. Enjoy!"

			"recipe": [
				"1. Preheat the oven to 425 \u00baF and prepare a large parchment-lined and oiled rimmed baking sheet.",
				"2. Prep the jalape\u00f1os: cut off the tops and cut around the white pith with a pairing knife. Then go in with a butter knife and scrape out as much of the seeds and membrane as you can. I found it easy to just stick the knife in (and don't use a sharp knife for this--you don't want any accidents!), and twist it around, which breaks off the white membrane and loosens the seeds, which can then be tapped or shaken out of the pepper, leaving a hollow jalape\u00f1o behind.",
				"3. Fill a piping bag, or a ziplock bag, with almond cheese and snip off the end. Pipe the cheese into the peppers.",
				"4. Set up three bowls as your dipping stations. In the first bowl mix together the ground flax and water and let sit for around 10 minutes to thicken. Alternatively you can microwave it in 30 second intervals a couple of times to speed the process. In the second bowl mix together the flour mixture, and mix together the bread crumb mixture in the third bowl.",
				"5. To dip: Take each stuffed jalape\u00f1o and dip first into the flax egg, and then into the flour mixture. Put it back into the flax mixture, and then toss in the bread crumbs. Then set on the greased baking tray. Continue with the remaining jalape\u00f1os. *If your flax mixture starts to thicken too much, add a little more water. To make the process easier, have 2 forks to help you move the jalape\u00f1os between stations, a fork for the dry flour and bread crumb mixture and a second one for the sticky flax mixture.",
				"6. Once all the jalape\u00f1os are breaded, spray them with oil, or drizzle some on top. Then bake them at 425 \u00baF for 25-30 minutes, flipping them over in the last 5-10 minutes for more even browning.",
				"7. They are best served warm, but are also tasty at room temperature!"

				"4. Sprinkle the salt and yeast over the top of the dough. Using wet hands, incorporate the salt and yeast by reaching under the edges of the dough and gently pulling it up and away from the sides of the bowl, then folding the dough to rest on top of salt mixture. Give the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat, until you've pulled and folded the dough over all the salt and yeast to cover. Next, pinch the dough into several segments between your first finger and thumb. Then repeat the folding process to bring the dough back together to one piece. Repeat this segmenting and folding a couple more times until the salt is well distributed. Rewet your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. All in all, this process will only take 1-2 minutes. Leave the dough to rest for around 10 minutes, covered.",
				"5. After ~10 minutes, sprinkle the toasted walnuts overtop, and incorporate with wet hands using the same method you used to add the salt and yeast. When the walnuts are well distributed with the final folding of the dough, turn the dough ball so the seam is face down in the bowl. Leave to rest for 20 minutes, covered.",

				"7. After incorporating the walnuts and letting the dough rest for 20 minutes you will apply the first fold. Using wet hands and the same process you did to fold dough over the salt and nuts, you will reach your hands under a section of the dough, lift gently so not to tear the dough, and place it over top the rest of the dough. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat around 4 times until you have a nice ball in the bowl. Rotate the ball so the seam is touching the bowl. Let rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the folding. Rest another 30 minutes and fold for the last time. Leaving the seam down, let the dough rise at room temperature at least another 30 minutes (no longer if your kitchen is much warmer than 70 \u00baF).",

				"10. While the oven is preheating, shape your bread.",
				"11. First prepare either a proofing basket or a large mixing bowl. If using a proofing basket, simply generously flour the basket and use your hands to distribute the flour around the bowl. If using a large mixing bowl, line it with a lint free towel, and then generously sprinkle flour onto the towel.",
				"12. Lightly flour a clean work surface, and gently ease the dough (so not to allow the gases formed to escape) onto the counter. Gently ease the dough into a large rough circle (the shape isn't important), being careful not to tear the dough. To shape the dough, you will begin with the same folding technique (this time with dry or lightly floured hands). Take a section of the dough and gently stretch it up until you feel resistance, then fold over the middle. Take the next section and repeat, and move around the dough until you have created a tight ball.",
				"13. Take the ball of dough and move over to an unfloured section of the counter. With the dough sitting on the counter seam side down, cup the dough ball between your hands with your pinky fingers resting on the counter behind it. Pull the dough towards you, allowing the friction between the dough and counter to pull the dough underneath itself, and using your pinky fingers to prevent the dough from simply rolling. Turn the dough about a quarter turn and repeat. Do this until you've gone in a full circle and the skin around the dough ball is taught. Sprinkle flour over the dough and spread it around with your hands until the dough is not sticky to touch. Then place the ball of dough into the prepared proofing basket or mixing bowl seam side down. Dust a little extra flour over top, then cover with a towel and leave to rise for ~60 minutes (If your kitchen is very warm you may only leave it for 45 minutes).",
				"14. To check the dough is ready for the oven, dip your finger first in a little flour, then poke the dough about 3/4\". If the indentation springs up slightly but then stops, leaving a smaller indentation, the dough is ready to bake. If it springs up almost 100% right away then it needs more time. If the dough doesn't spring back at all, it is overproofed, but that's ok, still bake it, just get it to the oven as quickly as possible.",
				"15. When the dough passes the indentation test, it's time to bake. Using oven mitts, carefully remove the dutch oven and take the lid off. Turn the proofing basket upside down on to a floured surface and tap the basket to release the dough. You should see some cracks on the top of the dough (where the seams were), this is where the dough will expand and crack and where the height of the loaf comes from.",
				"16. Using two hands, carefully lift the dough and drop it into the dutch oven (be careful of burning yourself!). Cover the pot and place it into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes covered. After 30 minutes, carefully remove the lid, turn the heat down to 450 \u00baF and bake an additional 20 minutes. You can bake longer for a darker crust, or slightly less time for a lighter crust.",
				"17. When you have reached your desired crust, remove the pot from the oven and turn the bread out. Place it on a cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 20-30 minutes before slicing into. It finishes baking outside of the oven in these last minutes.",
				"18. Enjoy your bread!",
				"19. To store, place cut side down on a cutting board, never place it in fridge, and do not put in a plastic bag. If it is going to take you more than 3 days to eat the bread, slice it and transfer it to a freezer bag, with pieces of parchment or wax paper between the slices. Keep frozen and toast as needed."

Then, wetting your hands to prevent the dough from sticking, squeeze sections of it between your thumb and first or middle finger to break it into several segments. Then scoop under the segments of dough and gently pull a section of the dough up and then fold it on top of itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat the gentle lift and fold a few times until you've gone in a full circle and the dough is a single mass again. Then repeat the segmenting and folding a couple more times (about 1 minute total pinching and folding time). The gluten in the dough will start to develop during this process. Finish on a fold, and rotate the dough so the seams on the fold are facing the bowl.",
				"3. Cover the dough and let rest for 20 minutes. Then turn the dough out onto a clean, floured counter and knead the dough for around 1 minute, until the dough is not too sticky and has developed a smooth skin.",

This will help remove starch from the potatoes so they bake crisper.",

How long it takes will depend on how high your heat is and how wide/shallow your pot is. Check with a measuring cup as you go until you have the correct volume. Set aside to cool to room temperature. This results in a viscous but pourable light caramel brown cream.",
				"2. *Note: if you make the condensed coconut milk the day before and refrigerate, you might need to bring it back closer to room temperature and thin with water to achieve a pourable consistency.",
				"3. First, preheat your oven to 350 \u00baF.",
				"4. In a stand mixer or with a handheld electric beater, lightly beat together the aquafaba and cream of tartar until frothy. Then turn up the speed until high and beat until you have stiff peaks. This takes 10 minutes with my stand mixer but could take longer on yours, and will take more time with a handheld electric mixer. You cannot over whip aquafaba, and if you do this too far in advance and it starts to deflate you can rewhip it back up to stiff peaks at any time.",
				"5. Prepare 2 parchment lined baking sheets, and make sure the oven is preheated to 350 \u00baF before beginning.",
				"6. In a large bowl, mix together the shredded coconut, almond flour, salt, and extracts you are using with a wooden spoon or a silicon spatula. Then stir in the condensed milk until it coats everything. At this point if you squeeze some of the mixture it will stick together but otherwise it does not tend to hold together.",
				"7. Take a large scoop of the whipped aquafaba (about 1/4-1/3 of the mixture), and using a silicon spatula, gently fold the aquafaba to incorporate it evenly in the coconut mixture. This step will help ensure more of the air stays trapped in the whip.",
				"8. Once mixed evenly add the remainder of the whipped aquafaba and gently fold that in.",
				"9. On a parchment lined baking sheet scoop 1 1/2\" (walnut sized) balls. You can either form them with your hands, or using a cookie scoop. Leave the balls rougher around the edges for more a uneven golden effect, or smooth them in your hands for a more evenly browned look. Place them on the baking sheets about 2\" apart.",
				"10. Bake for 25-30 minutes, checking towards the end, until you have reached your desired level of golden. I like to bake mine bold for more caramel rich flavor.",
				"11. Leave to cool completely, they will continue to firm as they cool. If you are dipping in chocolate, chilling the cooled cookies in the fridge will help make them a bit sturdier.",
				"12. Take each cookie and set it in the melted chocolate, and using a spoon or spatula, help lift it out from underneath the cookie so it doesn't get stuck in the chocolate. Alternatively, you can spoon some chocolate onto the bottom of each cookie.",
				"13. Place chocolate dipped cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet, and set in the fridge until chocolate is set, 30-60 minutes.",
				"14. Chilled the cookies should keep about a week, but they don't last that long in our house!"

				"6. Shape into balls: for large balls use a heaping tablespoon (~1 1/2 tbsp), for the small a heaping teaspoon (~ 1 1/2 tsp). Wet your hands to prevent any sticking and roll between your palms to get round balls.",
				"7. Place the balls onto prepared baking sheet and lightly mist with oil. Bake for 15 minutes, flip the balls, then bake an additional about 10 minutes, until golden. If making the other components, rinse out the food processor, but there is no need to clean it.",
				"8. Toast the pistachios and pepitas on a dry skillet over low heat for about 5 minutes, or until they smell toasty.",
				"9. Add garlic, pistachios, and pepitas to the food processor and process until finely ground.",
				"10. Add the arugula, basil, salt, pepper, and water. Process until its finely chopped.",
				"11. Stream in oil and process until smooth. Add lemon juice and pulse to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired. If making pizza sauce, don't even rinse your food processor after emptying, it just adds extra flavor!",
				"12. Add a couple spoonfuls of tomato and juice to the food processor, and the garlic, red pepper, salt, oregano, and olive oil. Process until smooth.",
				"13. Add the remaining tomatoes and their juice. Pulse until just broken up (~7 times). You want to maintain some texture.",
				"14. Preheat oven to 550 \u00baF (or as hot as your oven goes) or a full hour to fully saturate the oven with heat. If using a pizza stone, make sure that's in the oven as it preheats.",
				"15. Stretch out the pizza, 10 oz of dough makes one ~12\" pizza.",
				"16. Place dough on baking sheet if using, or pizza peel if baking on a stone.",
				"17. Spread sauce on the dough, then put on the chickpea balls, vegan cheese and pesto.",
				"18. Bake for 8-10 minutes, keeping a close eye on it at the end.*"

			"recipe": [
				"1. Pre-heat oven to 400 \u00baF",
				"2. Roll pie dough out and fit into a pie dish. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes while oven preheats. This helps prevent the dough from shrinking when blind baked.",
				"3. When oven is preheated, prepare the pie dough for blind baking. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the pie dough, then a piece of aluminum foil, and pour in pie weights or dried beans to fill. Bake for 20 minutes.",
				"4. Remove from oven and take away the weights. Replace in oven and bake an additional 5 minutes.",
				"5. Reduce oven to 375 \u00baF.",
				"6. While the pie dough is blind baking, steam the potatoes. Bring a pot of water to a boil, and place the potatoes in a steamer basket over the water and allow to steam for 10-12 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork. Set aside and allow to cool.",
				"7. In a medium bowl, measure the chickpea flour, cornstarch, nutritional yeast, spices, and salt. Whisk together.",
				"8. Pour in 1 cup of broth and whisk until smooth.",
				"9. In a large pot bring the remaining 1 1/4 cups of broth to a boil. Stream in the chickpea mixture while whisking, and lower the temperature to medium-low. Whisk constantly for about two minutes until the mixture begins to thicken and look glossy. Turn off heat.",
				"10. Stir in the sausage, onion, and potato until evenly distributed. Pour into the prepared pie shell. Brush the top with olive oil.",
				"11. Bake at 375 \u00baF for 25 minutes, or until filling is firm to the touch. Remove from oven and allow to cool fully before serving. If desired, re-heat to serve."

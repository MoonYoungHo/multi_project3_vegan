It\u2019s important to select a coconut milk that\u2019s creamy and smooth (not grainy or clumpy) to ensure that the yogurt is creamy and smooth. My favorite brands are: Whole Foods 365 full-fat (BPA-free), Aroy-D full-fat, and Thai Kitchen full-fat. Native Forest (BPA-free) isn\u2019t as creamy, but it still makes tasty yogurt. I would not recommend Trader Joe\u2019s (BPA-free), which was recently reformulated and is now chunky\/grainy. The recommended brands\u2019 full-fat coconut milks (and coconut cream) also work well for coconut whipped cream! For best results, I recommend using Whole Foods 365 for achieving the creamiest and thickest yogurt.\",\"2. Shake your coconut milk can well. Then open and pour into a clean (sterilized), dry glass jar or bowl. You can easily sterilize clean jars by rinsing throughly in boiling water and letting dry completely. Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like\u00a0this one from Weck. Often the coconut milk is separated, so once added to the jar, whisk to get it completely smooth.\",\"3. Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics. Stir until creamy and smooth, pushing the probiotic up against the side with your spoon to evenly disperse.\",\"4. Cover the mixture with cheesecloth (or a very thin, clean dish towel \u2013 something that lets air in but keeps bugs out) and secure with a rubber band.\",\"5. Let the yogurt activate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours (sometimes longer \u2013 48 hours is my sweet spot for thickness and tang) in a warm place. The longer it rests, the tangier the yogurt will become. In warmer climates and summer, it\u2019s easy to make yogurt if your house is warm (75 degrees F \/ 23 C and above). But in cooler climates or seasons, place the yogurt in the oven with the light on (do not turn on the oven), where it should have the right amount of heat to activate.\",\"6. Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)!\",\"7. NOTE: For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more as as any excess liquid strains to the bottom.\",\"8. To make the mango pur\u00e9e, add cubed mango and orange juice to a small blender or food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Add desired amount of mango pur\u00e9e (we used about half of the prepared amount) to your yogurt along with the vanilla and whisk\/stir to combine (this is most easily done in a mixing bowl). Taste and adjust flavor as needed. (Reserve any leftover mango pur\u00e9e for serving with yogurt or for smoothies.)\",\"9.

Make filling by adding coconut yogurt, soaked and drained cashews, the lesser amount of maple syrup (2 Tbsp (30 ml) as recipe is written), lemon juice, melted coconut oil, vanilla (optional), and sea salt.

SEE NOTES ABOVE FOR MORE TIPS! It\u2019s important to select a coconut milk that\u2019s creamy and smooth (not grainy or clumpy) to ensure that the yogurt is creamy and smooth. Our favorite brands are:\u00a0Savoy Coconut Cream, Aroy-D Coconut Milk,\u00a0and Whole Foods 365 full fat (BPA-free). Native Forest Full Fat\u00a0(BPA-free) isn\u2019t as creamy, but it still makes tasty yogurt. We would not recommend Trader Joe\u2019s (BPA-free), which was recently reformulated and is now chunky\/grainy.\u00a0\",\"2. Shake your coconut milk well. Then open and pour into a clean, sterilized, dry glass jar or bowl. You can easily sterilize clean jars by rinsing throughly with boiling water and letting dry completely. Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like\u00a0this one from Weck. Sometimes the coconut milk is separated, so after adding it to the jar, I stir with a whisk to get it completely smooth.\",\"3. Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics. Stir until creamy and smooth, pushing the probiotic up against the side with your spoon to evenly disperse.\",\"4. Cover the mixture with cheesecloth (or a very thin, clean dish towel \u2013 something that lets air in but keeps bugs out) and secure with a rubber band.\",\"5. Let the yogurt activate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours (sometimes longer \u2013 48 hours is my sweet spot for thickness and tang) in a warm place. The longer it rests, the tangier the yogurt will become. In warmer climates and summer it\u2019s easy to make yogurt if your house is warm (75 degrees F \/ 23 C and above). But in cooler climates or seasons, place the yogurt in the oven with the light on (do not turn on the oven), where it should have the right amount of heat to activate.\",\"6. That\u2019s it! Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)! For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, then loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more.\",\"7.

Place a large glass container in a dark, undisturbed location at room temperature. If you use a container with a spigot (which makes bottling a lot easier), choose a container with either a plastic spigot or a high-quality stainless steel spigot (304 grade or higher)*. Ideally, place the container about 10 inches (25 cm) off the floor to allow for ease of bottling. It will be hard to move the vessel when the tea has been added, so start with this step first.\",\"2. Make the sweetened tea by combining the boiled water, sugar, and tea in a clean glass container or pot. Stir to dissolve the sugar and allow it to steep until the tea has cooled to room temperature**.\",\"3. When cooled, remove the tea bags (or strain out the loose leaf tea) and add the sweetened tea to the large glass container.\",\"4. Add the starter tea to the large glass container as well. The starter tea serves to acidify the sweetened tea to a point where bad bacteria cannot take over.\",\"5. Then gently place the SCOBY on top of the liquid with clean hands.\",\"6. Cover the container with a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter and secure it with a rubber band. Avoid using cheesecloth, as the small openings are large enough for fruit flies to enter.\",\"7. Ferment for 6 to 10 days. Check on the kombucha periodically to ensure the SCOBY is thickening and that it looks healthy (no black spots or signs of fruit fly larvae). The SCOBY may not always float at the top, and that's okay. A new cream-coloured \\\"baby\\\" layer of SCOBY should start forming on the surface of the kombucha within a few days.\",\"8. After 6 days, give the brew a taste test. If the taste is to your liking (some like it sweeter, others like it tarter) then the kombucha is ready to bottle! Keep in mind that in warmer climates, the kombucha will ferment faster than in cooler climates. Also, the longer the tea is left to ferment, the less sweet and more acidic it becomes, as the SCOBY continues to eat up all the sugar.\",\"9. Using clean glass bottles with plastic lids, gently open the spigot of the large container housing the brew and fill your bottles about \u00be full. Leave at least 2 cups (480 mL) worth of brew in the large container to serve as the \\\"starter tea\\\" for the next batch.\",\"10. If you'd like to flavour your kombucha, add a juice of your choice to the bottle, leaving about 1 inch (2 cm) of air at the top of the bottle for carbonation. For the recipe pictured, I juiced fresh ginger and apples to add to my brew. Secure the lid and store the bottled kombucha at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for 24 - 48 hours, which will allow for carbonation. After this period, refrigerate to stop fermentation and carbonation.\",\"11. To make a new batch of kombucha, make the sweetened tea as outlined above and when cooled, add this to the large vessel already containing the SCOBY and starter tea. Cover the container with a new clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter and secure with a rubber band.

Place the strawberries and sugar in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the heat down to low and let simmer for about 10-12 minutes until thickened and syrupy. Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the sauce so it is smooth, pressing out the remaining pulp to extract the juice. You should end up with about 1 cup of strawberry sauce. Allow to fully cool and chill in the fridge.\",\"2. Whisk together the water and sugar in a small saucepan. Turn the heat on low and cover until the sugar is dissolved.\",\"3. Meanwhile add the reduced and cold aquafaba to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the cream of tartar. Whisk by hand with the whisk attachment until slightly frothy, then hook up and turn the mixer on a medium speed.\",\"4. Back to the sugar syrup, remove the lid (using the lid helps any sugar crystals on the side of the pot dissolve into the mixture) and set up a candy thermometer so it isn't touching the bottom of the pot. Watch the temperature carefully until it gets to 234 \u00baF (112 \u00baC) then turn up the stand mixer to high so that the aquafaba forms stiff peaks. You can turn up the heat to medium if you are careful and keep a close eye on the temperature.\",\"5. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches 248 \u00baF (120 \u00baC) it's ready to be added to the aquafaba meringue. At this point the meringue should have formed stiff peaks, which means that the meringue that clings to the whisk when removed will stay in a thin upright peak when inverted. If you invert the whole bowl over your head it shouldn't slide or budge a centimeter.\",\"6. When the syrup is at the edge of the firm and hard ball stages at 248 \u00baF and the meringue has reached stiff peaks, keep your mixer on high and slowly drizzle in the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to aim between the whisk and the edge of the bowl to keep the sugar syrup from splattering. Be careful as the sugar syrup is VERY hot. Pour the entire syrup into the meringue. The meringue will increase in size as the syrup is added.\",\"7. When all the syrup is added switch to a paddle attachment and turn it on to high. Let the mixture beat until it has fully cooled down. It should feel cool to the touch. You can speed up this process by placing an ice pack underneath the bowl if the shape of your mixer allows.\",\"8. Do not add the fat before the meringue has COMPLETELY cooled down. Once cool, leave the mixer at a high speed and very slowly add in the fat, just a spoonful at a time, letting it incorporate before adding the next spoon. If you do this slowly and all your ingredients are cold everything should work out fine (note: it's normal to lose volume when you add fat, but it thickens up as more fat is added). However, it can happen that the mixture breaks and looks curdled. Do not give up, keep adding the fat and it should come back together. It may need to be chilled if it doesn't come back together after adding the fat, so stick everything (bowl and paddle attachment) into the fridge to chill for several minutes before trying again.\",\"9. When your buttercream is thick and fluffy and all the fat has been added, turn the speed of the mixer down to medium and while running add in the vanilla extract. Then, with the mixer still running, slowly pour in the strawberry sauce. Start with 3\/4 cups of sauce and add more to taste and desired color is reached.\",\"10. At this point the buttercream can be used to frost a cake. If you want the frosting to firm up a little before decorating place in the fridge to chill and firm checking every several minutes. Once it's chilled sufficiently take it out and use to frost chilled cakes.\",\"11. If you want to make the buttercream in advance, you can refrigerate or freeze the frosting before the strawberry sauce is added. Bring the frosting to room temperature and re-fluff with the paddle attachment, then add the strawberry sauce and use immediately.\",\"12. See the post for details on decorating.\",\"13. Add the chopped chocolate to a heat proof bowl. Bring the coconut cream to a simmer over medium heat, then pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk from the center out until completely melted and smooth. Add the corn syrup and a pinch of salt and mix just to combine.\",\"14. Let the chocolate sauce cool until it runs easily and thickly off of a spoon, then pour the chocolate sauce into drips along the edge of the frosted and chilled cake using a spoon. Once you've made all your dips pour additional sauce to cover the top of the cake, spreading using an offset spatula and gently tipping the cake. To make a spiral design: let chocolate cool slightly and firm up, then place the tip of the spatula in the center of the cake and spin the cake slowly around while letting the spatula slide outwards as it rotates.\",\"15. Cut the cake when chilled for cleanest cuts, but serve at or close to room temperature for the best textures.\"]","recipe_id":6275,"serving":"~10 cups frosting","time":"1 hour 42 minutes","title":"Vegan Aquafaba Strawberry Italian Meringue Buttercream","total_fat":null},"881":{"calories":null,"carbs":null,"category":"3.Dessert+ Bread <Main ingredients: sugar\/milk\/coconut\/vanilla\/butter\/almond>","image":"https:\/\/www.thecuriouschickpea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/chocolatehazelnuttruffles-1.jpg","ingredients":"[8 oz (227g) 70% dark chocolate, 3\/4 cups (210g) hazelnut milk, 2 tbsp (25g) granulated sugar, 1\/8 tsp fine sea salt, 1 tsp (5mL) vanilla extract, 2 tsp (10mL) olive oil, 12oz (285g) 70% dark chocolate, ground hazelnuts, for melted chocolate finish option or a dusting finish on the tempered chocolate, 56-60 whole toasted hazelnuts (optional), flaked salt, such as Maldon sea salt, for tempered chocolate finish option (optional)]","link":"https:\/\/www.thecuriouschickpea.com\/vegan-chocolate-hazelnut-truffles\/","pk":6312,"protein":null,"recipe":"[\"1. Finely chop the 8oz of chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.\",\"2. In a small pot bring the hazelnut milk, sugar, and salt to a simmer. Whisk a couple of times as it heats to dissolve the sugar.\",\"3. Once simmering, remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Rotate the bowl to swirl the milk and submerge the chocolate. Cover the bowl with a plate or lid and let sit undisturbed for 4-5 minutes.\",\"4. At this point the chocolate should be warm and melty. Add the vanilla extract and the olive oil, then whisk the chocolate, until the mixture is smooth. Start in the center and work out towards the edges as the chocolate melts and the ganache forms.\",\"5. Test the ganache for texture by dipping a small spoon into the melty ganache, then placing it in the fridge on a small plate. After 15 minutes the ganache should be firm and creamy. If it is too hard, you can whisk in an additional couple teaspoons of hazelnut milk.\",\"6. Pour the ganache into a 9\\\" baking dish or pyrex storage container (line the bottom with parchment or plastic wrap if you want to make rectangular truffles). Let the ganache cool to room temperature, then place it in the fridge uncovered. Let the ganache chill until the top is firm to the touch, then cover with plastic wrap or parchment so that it is touching the top of the ganache. Let the ganache firm up in the fridge for at least 3 hours, or overnight. It can last in the fridge for up to 1 week.\",\"7. When ready to shape the truffle centers, prepare a rimmed baking sheet or shallow baking dish by lining with parchment paper. Use a small 1\/2-tablespoon scoop to make uniform truffles, or use a heaping teaspoon or eyeball 3\/4\\\" rounds and scoop with a small spoon. If desired, place a single toasted hazelnut inside the ganache, pushing it in, then manipulating the soft ganache to cover the hazelnut. Regardless, roll each scoop between the palms of your hand to form a sphere. Don't worry about it being perfectly round. Wash the chocolate off your palms as necessary to prevent sticking. Shape the ganache with dry hands. If the ganache gets to warm to shape, stick it in the refrigerator or freezer until it's firmed up again.\",\"8. If shaping into rectangles, remove the ganache from the container and place on a cutting board. Put a mug filled with hot water next to your work station, and a paper towel or kitchen towel next to you. Warm a sharp knife in the hot water, then dry with the towel. Cut the ganache into your desired shapes, warming the knife as needed between cuts.\",\"9. Set each truffle center on the parchment paper, covering with parchment paper and adding layers of truffles as necessary until all centers are shaped. Place in the fridge to firm up for at least 20 minutes before coating with your choice of chocolate finish, or up to overnight. You can also freeze them for longer, but move to the refrigerator at least 4 hours before dipping in the chocolate finish.\",\"10. Melt the chocolate using a water bath technique or in the microwave. To use a water bath, bring a small pot of water to a low simmer and place a heat proof bowl over top the pot. The bottom of the bowl should NOT be touching the water or the chocolate can burn. Let the chocolate start to look melty, then stir with a silicon spatula. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is fully melted. Remove from the heat and set up your work station.\",\"11. Have the chocolate centers on the parchment paper next to the bowl of melted chocolate. On a plate spread a layer of ground hazelnuts for coating.\",\"12. Using a chocolate dipping tool or a fork, dip each ganache center into the melted chocolate, rolling around to fully coat, then place on plate and roll in ground hazelnuts to coat. Place the truffle back onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with each center until you've finished all of them. Place in the fridge to firm up. Keep these truffles stored in a sealed container in the fridge, but you can remove them an hour before serving so they are not cold.\",\"13. Remove your ganache centers from the refrigerator and temper the chocolate.\",\"14. First, reserve one good-sized chunk (~1 1\/2 - 2\\\") of chocolate from your 12oz of chocolate. Finely chop the remaining chocolate and place in a heat proof bowl.\",\"15. Bring a small amount of water to a simmer over low heat and place the bowl of chocolate over the pot. The bowl of chocolate should NOT touch the water or the chocolate can burn.*IMPORTANT: make sure that no water touches the melted chocolate or the chocolate will seize and you will NOT be able to temper it.\",\"16. Warm the chocolate over the water bath, whisking occasionally, until melted. It should be 100-110 \u00baF. Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let cool to the low 80-degrees F, whisking regularly to encourage crystallization. When the temperature reaches the low 80s F, add the reserved chunk of chocolate and bring the melted chocolate back up to 88-90 \u00baF. To do this, place it over the barely simmering pot of water for a few seconds, then remove and whisk vigorously. Check the temperature and repeat as necessary until you've reached the 88 \u00baF. Be very careful and slow here so you do not jump back up to over 91 \u00baF and lose your tempering. If that happens, let the mixture cool back down, re-seed with another chunk of chocolate and try again.\",\"17. Once you've reached that 88-90 \u00baF, check that the chocolate is tempered. Smear a small amount of the chocolate on a plate and it should harden and turn shiny within a few minutes.\",\"18. Keep the chocolate between this 88-90 \u00baF range and dip the truffle centers in the chocolate. It's easiest to work with the chocolate dipping forks. Dip the ganache center in, rolling to fully coat, then pull up and let some chocolate drip down, then wipe off the bottom of the fork on the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate before transferring to the parchment lined tray. Immediately sprinkle with ground nuts or a couple of flakes of salt for garnish. Alternatively, you can use a piping bag with a tiny hole to drizzle a little tempered chocolate over top all of them once finished.\",\"19. Keep the tempered chocolate off the heat while you continue to dip the truffles. Check the temperature as you go, and if it starts to cool off much under 88\u00baF, place it back on the warm bowl of water just for a few seconds, whisk and recheck the temperature. If you leave the bowl of chocolate over the hot water, it may get too hot and you will need to re-temper.\",\"20. Any extra tempered chocolate can be spread into a mold, or poured over a piece of parchment paper and allowed to harden. It can just be enjoyed as you would a chocolate bar!\",\"21. Let the chocolate truffles set at room temperature, or speed the process by putting in the fridge for a few minutes. These truffles can be stored at room temperature. Note that if you used the flaked salt to decorate the truffles, over the course of a couple of days, the salt may pull moisture from the air and chocolate and the salt can look melty. This is especially true if it is very humid out.\"]","recipe_id":6312,"serving":"56-60 small truffles","time":"4 hours 35 minutes","title":"Vegan Chocolate Hazelnut Truffles","total_fat":null}}}

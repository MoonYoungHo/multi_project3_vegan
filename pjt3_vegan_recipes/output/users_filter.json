Spread over a layer of the buttercream, using a palette knife to get an even, neat finish. Top with the second sponge and spread over another layer of buttercream.\",\"8. Top with the last sponge upside-down, so the bottom of the cake becomes the top (this will help to keep the icing neat and relatively crumb-free). Spread the sides of the cake with buttercream. Hold the top sponge steady with a palm if you need to stabilise the cake. Once you have the sides covered as neatly as you can, cover the top with a thin layer of buttercream. Use your palette knife to neaten the top and sides. If you have a side scraper, use it to sweep around the sides and top to sharpen the coating.

( There will be 3 layers of butternut \u2013 so you could divide into 3, placing any misshapen pieces in the middle layer)\",\"3. Cook the Leeks: Slice and rinse the leeks- the moisture here will help them soften. Heat oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the leeks, for 8-10 minutes, covering part way through so they soften. Add the garlic, sage and a pinch of salt, cook 2-3 more minutes. Turn heat off.\",\"4.

A big shallow pan is BEST here ensuring even cooking. Grease the pan, add 1\/4 cup water to the bottom of the pan. Layer with Butternut squash overlapping slightly. Sprinkle with half of the sauteed leeks. Drizzle with 1\/3 cup cream mixture. Sprinkle with one ounce of Gruyere (about 3-4 tablespoons grated). Add the 2nd layer of butternut- using up any misshapen pieces here. Scatter with the remaining leeks. Drizzle with 1\/3 cup cream mixture and sprinkle with grated gruyere cheese. Add the final layer of butternut, overlapping and pressing down so not domed in the middle. Drizzle the remaining cream mixture over top, lightly sprinkle with cheese and the walnuts. Give the pan a little shake, press down in the center again so gratin is level, not domed. Cover, using parchment first as a barrier, under the foil if the foil touches the top of the gratin.\",\"6. Bake 45 minutes covered. Uncover, confirming the butternut is tender using the tip of a knife, then bake at 400 F uncovered, 15 minutes until beautifully golden.\",\"7. To make the crispy sage leaf garnish, heat 1-2 tablespoons oil or butter in a pan over medium heat, add 8 whole sage leaves, saute each side 30 seconds or so until crisp (try a tester first) and place on a paper towel to cool for a couple of minutes.

Add \u00bc cup kefir grains to each jar.\",\"4.

Add \u00bc of a lemon wedge to each jar.\",\"6. Add 1 prune to each jar.\",\"7. Cover both jars with a thin kitchen cloth and leave on the counter for 2-4 days. 2 days if warm out, 3-4 days if cold. This 2-4 day time period allows the grains \u201cto eat\u201d the sugar, so most of the sugar will actually be metabolized, and not end up in the drink itself. You want the water to get the point where it is just slightly sweet, and nicely tangy. So taste it before moving to the next step. If it tastes very sweet, it\u2019s not ready. When it\u2019s cold this takes longer.\",\"8. After 2-3 days the kefir will have fermented slightly, taste tangy or lightly sour, but there is one more step which gives it flavor and makes it effervescent and bubbly.\",\"9. FLAVOR: Get your third jar ready and place 1- 1 1\/2 cups fresh, ripe fruit in it\u2013 like fresh berries, peaches, mango, pineapple, plums, concord grapes, apples, pears \u2013 I muddle them up a bit to release their juices. Add a few thin slices of ginger, or whole spices if you wish. Or add 1 cup fruit juice \u2013 especially nice in winter when fresh fruit is limited.\",\"10. Strain both jars of the fermenting kefir water into the third clean jar with the fresh fruit in it, straining out the kefir grains ( set them aside), tossing the lemon and prunes, filling the clean jar (with the fruit in it) to a 1\/2 inch from the top. Then cover tightly with a lid, and leave this on the counter another 24 hours, allowing pressure to build up yet, burping the lids (releasing the pressure), every 8-12 hours or so, more often especially if warm. Keep in mind, not burping may cause the jar to explode. If you must leave them for longer, either loosen the lid and place jar in a bowl to collect runoff, or place the jar in the fridge, to slow the fermentation down, and continue fermenting on the counter when you have more time.\",\"11. WARNING: These metal lids like in the photos above, have pros and cons. They allow pressure to build up, with their tight seal, creating bubbly effervescent kefir, but they can explode if the pressure is not released occasionally. Plastic lids are \u201cself-burping\u201d, which if you are away from home for over 8 hours, I would recommend using. The downside is the plastic lids do not let the pressure build quite enough in my opinion so kefir is not quite as bubbly. Sometimes I switch between both, depending on if I am planning to be gone.\",\"12. To reiterate- During the 2nd fermentation phase, the water kefir is creating gas and building pressure, which you want it to do \u2013 this makes it nice and bubbly, but with the metal lids, you must let out some of the pressure, \u201cburping it\u201d every 6-12 hours or so, so the lid doesn\u2019t bend or blast open (yes this happened to me). With a plastic lid, it stays on fine, it self burps, but it\u2019s less bubbly.\",\"13. After 24 hours, the fruit will float to the surface and it\u2019s time to refrigerate it. Burp it, place it in the fridge, lid tight. Once it\u2019s chilled, give it a try. You can strain this and put it in a different pourable container, or just strain as you pour, leaving the fruit in for maximum infusion. Up to you.\",\"14. The kefir grains that you strained out earlier should be stored in a smaller jar, in the extra kefir water you will have after you merge the two jars into one. You can refrigerate them and feed with a tablespoon of sugar, every week \u2013or if trying to grow more grains to give away, store the jar on the counter, feeding every couple of days. They grow faster at room temp, and grow slower in the fridge. They are happiest when they are actually making water kefir, so I usually make a jar a week.

Mix the flour, sugar, salt and xantham gum (if using a gluten-free flour mix instead of an all purpose wheat flour) in a large bowl or a food processor.

Add chopped coconut oil and cut it into the flour using a pastry cutter (or two knives) or pulse in a food processor until you obtain a sandy texture that clumps together when you grab a handful, with no large lumps of fat left. To check for large lumps, shake the bowl \u2013 it will bring large bits of oil to the surface.\",\"3. While you can do this step in the food processor, I strongly suggest you transfer the mixture to a large bowl at this point and do this manually as then you have a greater amount of control. Slowly and very gradually trickle in some ice cold water, incorporating it into the flour using a fork. Keep going until the dough is moist enough that it can be brought together by hand \u2013 clump a bit of mixture with your hand, if it sticks together (without being wet!) you\u2019ve added enough water. I ended up using just short of 105 ml \/ 7 tbsp of water, but please go through the process as I described above instead of just adding the amount I added as different flour brands have different absorbency levels.\",\"4. Empty your bowl (or a food processor bowl) onto a work surface and bring all the dough together using your hands, but do not knead if you are working with gluten flour (overworking the dough will make the pastry tough). Form the dough into a flattened disc, wrap it up in cling film and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the ricotta filling (see below).\",\"5. After the dough has had a chance to rest, cut 1\/3 of it and set it aside. Gently and slowly roll 2\/3 of the dough out on a lightly floured surface. You may want to do it between two sheets of baking paper as it stops the dough sticking to the bench. When it comes to gluten-free dough, you may find it easier (I did) to simply mould it to the inside of the tart tins with your fingers.\",\"6. Roll the dough into a large circle 2 cm \/ 1\u2033 bigger than the tart case (I used a 25 cm \/ 10\u2033 diameter tart case). Roll the dough sheet over the rolling pin, place the rolling pin over the case and unroll it gently.

When the mixture has mostly stuck together turn the mixture out on to a work surface or bread\u00a0board.\",\"4. Knead the mixture by holding one end of the dough in one hand and stretching it out with the other hand. You then reform the dough, turn it 90 degrees and start again. Halfway through the kneading incorporate coconut oil (solid not melted) into the dough. It will make the dough slippery at first, you might think it has been ruined \u2013 but it has not, it will make for a richer dough. Keep on kneading and the dough will become elastic and smooth soon. In total the kneading should take about 15 minutes for this amount of dough.\",\"5. When the dough is smooth, form it into a ball and coat in a thin layer of oil. Place in a large mixing bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave it in a warm place (but not too warm!) until it has doubled in size \u2013 about 1 hr. It\u2019s a good idea to take a photo of the dough at the beginning so that you are sure when it has doubled in volume.

Spread a thin layer (you don\u2019t want the buns to end up soggy) of blended rhubarb all over the rolled out dough.

Now, depending on your baking dish, divide the dough into 9 or 12 even (4-3 cm \/ 1.5 \u2013 1.1\u2033) segments. I find that a square or round dish, like mine, needs 9 and a rectangular one needs 12 pieces. Use a long piece of sewing thread to do the cutting as it does not squash the filling as much as a knife does. Place the thread under the snake and overlap the thread on the top of the snake where you want the cut to be, pull tight to cut.\",\"11. Place the segments, swirls face up, on a lightly oiled baking dish, leaving 1-2 cm between each bun. If you can fill the baking tray, this is ideal.\",\"12. Leave the buns (covered with a kitchen towel) to prove again for another hour. Toward the end of this time, preheat the oven to 175\u00b0 C \/ 350\u00b0 F.\",\"13.

If any gaps form, quickly fill them with a little more batter, but be careful not to make the pancakes too thick by ladling too much extra batter on top of the set batter. There should be lots of little holes forming on the surface as soon as the batter hits the hot pan. If they don\u2019t form it means that your pan \/ oil isn\u2019t hot enough!\",\"12. Allow the pancake to cook on one side without touching it until the edges become golden and start lifting up gently (approx. 2-3 minutes). Turn the pancake gently using a large spatula and cook on the other side for 1-2 more minutes. The longer you cook them the crispier they\u2019ll become, but they will lose their flexibility. I don\u2019t mind that, but please adjust the cooking time to YOUR preference. Also be aware of your pan\u2019s hot spots \u2013 once you flip your pancake, make sure you adjust its position on the other side to ensure that there are no raw batter areas.\",\"13. Fill each crepe with sweet potato filling and sprinkle with a generous amount of coriander.

Towards the end, the mixture will become very thick and heavy and your blender may struggle to turn.

If you are making this dish a day in advance, I recommend not cooking vegetables until just before serving.\",\"9. In terms of the veggies, you could simply cook them in the simmering curry, but that gives you less control over the \u2018doneness\u2019 of the individual elements and it affects the colour of the greens. Put the potato in first (takes about 12 minutes) and cover the pot with a lid. After 6 minutes, add in the beans and cauliflower. After another 2 minutes add in the tenderstem broccoli and halved baby corn and continue simmering (with the lid on) for another 4 minutes or so.\",\"10. Another way to cook the green veggies, which I personally like as it preserves their vibrant colour and allows you to control crispness better, is to steam them. I steamed my beans for 2 minutes, then added the tenderstem broccoli and continued for 2 more minutes.\",\"11.

I keep on doing that while the mixture is blending, being extra careful that I go nowhere near the blades. This technique allows me to get the mixture super smooth and creamy, but use it at your own discretion.\",\"4. Taste and adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to taste. Add miso and nutritional yeast at this point if using. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture tastes quite strong at this point, it will mellow out during the next two stages of preparation.\",\"5. If you want your \u2018feta\u2019 to be shaped like a block, find a rectangular mould with drainage holes (I used this tofu press for this) and line it with a piece of dense cheesecloth (if the cheesecloth isn\u2019t dense enough to hold the mixture inside, double or triple layer it). Otherwise line a sieve with a piece of cheesecloth and place it over a bowl.\",\"6. Place the cheese mixture inside the cheesecloth. Even out with a spatula if you are making a block, if not bring the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a ball. Fold one side of the cheesecloth over evened out feta, then place the tofu press lid on top and weigh the mixture down (block) or squeeze very gently (bundle) to allow the excess water to drip away. Place in the fridge overnight to allow the mixture to thicken and for the excess moisture to drain away. At this point the cheese will be creamy but still fairly soft \/ wet \u2013 perfect for spreading on a bagel, but for this application we will need to dry it out in the oven.\",\"7. Gently place the drained cheese block \/ ball on a paper lined baking tray. Bake in a 140\u00ba C (285 \u00ba F) oven for about 45 minutes, until you feel quite a bit of resistance when you try to press the cheese gently with your finger. Allow it to cool down completely before cutting or it will fall apart. After baking, this cheese has a yellow crust (more pronounced if you use olive oil), which I simply trim off with a serrated knife before placing it on the salad.\",\"8. This cheese freezes well, so if you\u2019ve made too much (I tend to make a double batch), freeze some for putting on a pizza or in a salad later.\"]},{\"SALAD AND DRESSING\":[\"1.

Be careful not to dip the spatula in too deep as you don\u2019t want to accidentally touch the turning blades. If you follow the technique I\u2019ve described above, there should be enough moisture in this recipe (from coconut cream, lemon juice and maple syrup if using) not to have to use any water, which means you\u2019ll end up with a thick and smooth cream-cheese like mixture.\",\"4.

Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.\",\"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel, the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in the warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.\",\"3. There is a chance that once you add the coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup \/ 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove and reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce.\"]},{\"CARAMEL SAUCE (HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE)\":[\"1. Slowly heat up maple syrup in a pan. When it starts to boil gently, take it off the heat. Stir in almond butter and salt with a hand whisk. Return the pan to the stove and simmer very gently, stirring the caramel for another minute to thicken the sauce a little bit \u2013 remember that it will thicken a bit more as it cools anyway. If it\u2019s too thick once cool, stir in a few drops of plant milk to bring the desired consistency back.

If after a little bit of kneading the dough isn\u2019t holding together (initially it\u2019s supposed to be a bit dry to the touch but hold together), it may need a bit more hot water. It is very important to add the water in very small amounts\u00a0as too much water will negatively affect the dough. Knead it for about 5-10 minutes with your hands (after kneading the dough should become very smooth and elastic, but not sticky) and then set aside for 30 minutes under\u00a0a damp kitchen towel so that the dough doesn\u2019t dry up.\",\"2. Once the dough has had a chance to rest, grab 1\/6 of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface.

Place a heaped teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each circle, fold the circle in half and press the edges of the semi-circle together with your fingers. Go over each dumpling twice to make sure everything is sealed completely. Put the finished\u00a0dumplings on a lightly floured surface and cover them with a damp kitchen towel while making the rest so that they don\u2019t dry out.

Sift flour, icing sugar and cacao into a mixing bowl. Add olive oil and rub it into the dry ingredients with your hands. Finally add water \u2013 be careful, do it gradually \u2013 how much water you\u2019ll need depends on how absorbent your flour is (mine needed 25 ml).

Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 4 portions. Place each portion of the dough between two sheets of baking paper and roll gently until you get a rough circle, about 2-3 mm in thickness. (Below a photo from another tart recipe illustrates how to line tart moulds with shortcrust pastry).\",\"3. Put each rolled-out pastry over each mould and and work the pastry into the mould\u00a0making sure it reaches all nooks and crannies. Once you are happy with the coverage, trim off the excess pastry with a sharp knife. Prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork in a few places.

Cool pastry cases down completely before pouring any of the filling in.\"]},{\"CARAMEL\":[\"1. Spread an even layer of sugar at the bottom of a dry pan or pot. Heat up sugar on a medium heat (I used setting 3 out of 6). Refrain from stirring it, although if your pan has hot spots, you may need to gently manoeuvre unmelted sugar into a hot spot. Meanwhile, warm up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a separate pot.\",\"2. Once all the sugar has melted, let the sugar caramelise and darken slightly (it will happen quite quickly so be careful not to burn it). The darker the caramel the less sweet it will be. Once the sugar achieves the colour you are after, take the pan off the heat and slowly stir in warmed up coconut milk and then add salt. Be very careful as even though warming milk up minimises this, caramel may be splattering at this point and it will be very hot.\",\"3. There is a chance that once you add coconut milk, some of the caramel will harden into big lumps. What you need to do is to return the pan to the stove and set on a very low setting (I used 2 out of 6) to allow these lumps to melt away. Make sure you keep on stirring the mixture. Now, because the longer you cook your caramel sauce the more sticky and less sauce-like it will become, if you do need to bring it back to the stove to melt any stubborn lumps, add another \u00bc cup \/ 60 ml of coconut milk to the pan to ensure that once your lumps have dissolved the caramel will retain sauce consistency. Do not panic if it appears to be too runny at first, caramel thickens as it cools down. If it does end up being too runny, place the pan back on the stove an reduce the caramel gently to thicken the sauce.\"]},{\"CHOCOLATE GANACHE\":[\"1. Melt the chocolate very slowly (I used setting 1 out of 6) over a water bath. Once melted, remove from heat, but keep the bowl with chocolate over the hot water. Start adding coconut milk whisking gently the whole time. At this point the chocolate may seem to have seized a little, don\u2019t worry, keep on whisking gently and any lumps will eventually melt away. Once you have added all coconut milk, add water stirring the whole time.\",\"2. Once you have a smooth ganache, add 2 tsp of maple syrup \u2013 this is not strictly necessary as I find that bitter chocolate provides a nice contrast against very sweet caramel, but that\u2019s up to you.\",\"3.

Then add the vegan butter to a saucepan and let it melt before you add the brown sugar and coconut milk\/cornstarch mix. Stir constantly until the mixture boils and starts to thicken, then remove it from the heat and add in the vanilla, coconut flakes and chopped pecans. Set aside to cool completely before using.\",\"7. Prepare your chocolate buttercream frosting. Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vegan butter, 3 Tbsp of coconut milk and vanilla extract to the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Start off at slow speed, gradually increasing speed until it's very thick and smooth. If needed, add in extra coconut milk a tiny bit at a time to get to the ideal consistency. \",\"8. When the cakes are completely cool and your coconut\/pecan filling is completely cold, then you can finalize your cake. Add all the coconut\/pecan filling to the middle layer and then all the chocolate buttercream to the top. If you want to frost the sides as well you can do that, there is enough frosting to allow for this.\",\"9.

TO CUT ARTICHOKE: With the artichoke held on its side on a cutting board, use a large serrated knife to cut off the top third (~1 inch), creating a flat top revealing the inner petals. Then cut off the stem right to the base of the artichoke so it can sit flat on the cutting board. \",\"2. TO STEAM ARTICHOKE: Add ~2 inches of water to a large pot with a steamer basket insert over the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, cut a lemon in half and rub the outside of the artichoke petals and flat top with the lemon to prevent browning. Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to medium and place the artichoke(s) top side down in the steamer basket and cover with a lid. Steam for ~25-35 minutes (depending on the size of your artichokes), adding more water after 15 minutes to avoid scorching your pot. \",\"3. SAUCE: While the artichoke is cooking, prepare your choice of sauce for dipping (Lemon Dill Butter or Creamy Lemon Dill Dip). The Lemon Dill Butter is lighter and more lemony and the Creamy Lemon Dill Dip is more of a classic, mayo-based dip that\u2019s lightened up with coconut yogurt. To prepare either dip, stir all ingredients together in a small bowl. Adjust by adding more lemon juice for tartness or salt to taste. \",\"4. HOW TO KNOW YOUR ARTICHOKE\u2019S COOKED: Use tongs to carefully transfer the artichokes to a cutting board or serving plate. To check if they\u2019re done, pull out a petal \u2014 it should pull straight out easily. If it doesn\u2019t, return the artichoke to the steamer basket and cook for ~5 minutes more, or until the petals slide out easily. \",\"5. HOW TO EAT ARTICHOKE: When ready to eat, place the artichoke on a serving plate. Working from the outside, pull each leaf\/petal out one at a time. The edible part is the slightly thicker bottom part of the petal where it was attached. Dip that into the sauce and use your teeth to scrape out the small soft bit at the bottom while holding the top of the petal. Discard the remaining petal (it\u2019s difficult to chew). Repeat this process until you get petals with pink on them (they don\u2019t have much edible flesh). \",\"6. ARTICHOKE HEART: The pink petals are a sign you\u2019re almost to the artichoke heart (the tender center). Peel off and discard all the petals until you get to a part that looks like a lot of hairy fibers. Use a spoon to go around the edge where the fibers join the soft flesh and scoop in a circular motion to remove and discard the hair-like fibers called the choke (they\u2019re inedible). The remaining round portion is the heart, and it\u2019s edible, buttery, and tender. Slice it up and dip it in the sauce or spoon the sauce on top. \",\"7.

Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt to taste (for flavor balance), cinnamon for warmth, ginger for spice (optional), or coconut sugar for sweetness. You want the masa to be pretty flavorful with a noticeable amount of salt for depth to balance the sweetness of the apple butter filling. Set aside.\",\"7. ASSEMBLY: Arrange so the wide end of the husk is closest to you and ensure no residual water is left on the husk (pat dry as needed). Then place 2 heaping tablespoons of masa dough on the wider end of the corn husk and spread out into a thin, even layer toward one edge of the husk, leaving the narrow (upper) end empty (see photo).\",\"8. Place about ~1 \u00bd tablespoons of apple butter along the center of the masa, creating a log lengthwise. Fold 1 side of the husk over the filling (toward the empty side of the husk), then keep rolling until the seams meet. With the tamale seam side up, fold the narrow end of the husk away from you and under the tamale. Set aside (upright in a loaf pan or bowl) and repeat with remaining tamales (as recipe is written, you should have ~24 tamales).\",\"9. Place a steamer basket into a large pot and pour in enough water to fill just below the steamer basket. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low.\",\"10. Place the tamales, standing upright (with their open ends up) in the steamer basket. Put the lid back on, and steam\/simmer for 1 hour. The tamales are done when the husk pulls away from the dough easily, the masa appears puffy in appearance, and the tamale doesn\u2019t feel limp or soggy. Let the tamales rest for 10 minutes uncovered (off the heat) before serving. During this time, they will continue to firm up and become even easier to unwrap from the husk. If you\u2019re unsure if they\u2019re done, remove one tamale and let it rest for 10 minutes outside of the pot to see if it unwraps easily. If it\u2019s still sticky or tender, return to the pot and continue steaming for another 5-10 minutes until it's firm and easy to unwrap.\",\"11. To serve, unwrap tamales and enjoy warm as is, or top with vegan vanilla ice cream, coconut whipped cream, vegan caramel sauce (or a drizzle of maple syrup or date syrup), and\/or a sprinkle of ground cinnamon.\",\"12. Store cooled tamales covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in the microwave or in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop until hot.\",\"13. To freeze, let tamales cool, then add to a parchment-lined baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. Freeze until firm, then transfer to a well-sealed container where they should keep for at least 1 month, oftentimes longer. To cook from frozen, let thaw, then heat either in the microwave or in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop until hot.

It should look like play dough \u2014 scoopable, moldable, not too tacky or crumbly.\",\"5. Place a piece of parchment or wax paper on the counter and transfer the cookie dough onto the paper. Mold the dough together into a disc and place another piece of parchment or wax paper on top of the dough. Using a rolling pin, begin rolling the dough between the pieces of paper until it is 1\/4-inch thick. Then, using a 2-inch circle cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible (see notes if you don\u2019t have a cookie cutter). Use a spatula or butter knife to carefully transfer the cookies to the parchment-lined baking sheet(s). They won\u2019t spread too much, so they should all fit on one large baking sheet (but do use more as needed to avoid overcrowding).\",\"6. Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges just begin to turn golden brown (a little cracking on top is normal). While the cookies bake, roll out any remaining dough and cut more cookies. Then repeat the baking process with remaining dough.\",\"7. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes on the baking sheet. Enjoy with a glass of dairy-free milk or a warm cup of English breakfast tea.

If not baking immediately, cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days (the cookies will develop a bit more flavor and slightly firmer texture if the dough chills, but chilling this long is not necessary).\",\"5. Scoop dough into roughly 2-Tablespoon amounts (I like this scoop) and place on prepared baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap in between each cookie to allow for spreading. Press down slightly with your palm to form a disc. Then use fingers to tuck in any raisins that might be sticking out. There should be about 12 cookies.\",\"6. Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are slightly golden brown and they\u2019ve puffed up and expanded a bit.

Depending on your ingredients, you may need more or less. At this time you can whisk in some espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor (optional). Start with recommended amount and add more to taste.\",\"5. Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pan(s) and bake on a center rack for 28-38 minutes (if baking cupcakes, bake time should be 18-20 minutes), or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out free of crumbs (a little brown color is okay) and the edges appear dry \/ slightly pulled away from the pan. Be careful not to over-bake.\",\"6. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. To remove from pans, run a dull knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes. Then place a plate or cooling rack on top and quickly invert. Let cool completely before frosting (~1 hour \/\/ expedite the process by cooling briefly in the refrigerator or freezer).\",\"7. At this point you can enjoy your cake as is. But we recommend frosting with Vegan Chocolate Ganache Frosting or our Vegan Chocolate Frosting (Oil-Free) (pictured above).\",\"8. Best fresh and within the first couple days after baking. The texture tends to become dried out after that (using dairy-free yogurt in place of applesauce adds more moisture!). Store cake covered at room temperature for 2-3 days* or in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Freeze up to 1 month (then thaw at room temperature). \"]","recipe_id":3261,"serving":"14 (Slices)","time":"55 minutes","title":"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake","total_fat":"12.4g"},"803":{"calories":"123kcal","carbs":"22.5g","category":"3.Dessert+ Bread <Main ingredients: sugar\/milk\/coconut\/vanilla\/butter\/almond>","image":"https:\/\/minimalistbaker.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AMAZING-1-Bowl-Vegan-Gluten-Free-Chocolate-Cake-Oil-Free-naturally-sweetened-RICH-delicious-plantbased-glutenfree-chocolate-cake-recipe-minimalistbaker-7.jpg","ingredients":"[2 cups packed pitted dates  (measured after pitting), 1\/2 cup creamy cashew butter (or sub another nut or seed butter, such as peanut butter), 1\/2 cup cocoa or cacao powder, 1 pinch sea salt, 1 dash vanilla extract, 1\/4 \u2013 1\/2 cup almond or light coconut milk]","link":"https:\/\/minimalistbaker.com\/vegan-chocolate-frosting-oil-free\/","pk":3262,"protein":"2.4g","recipe":"[\"1.

Then add ~1 \u00bd Tbsp of the mashed sweet potatoes to the center of the masa and top with ~1 Tbsp of beans (see photo). Tuck the right side of the corn husk over the bean filling, right where the masa's left edge is. Then continue rolling until the seams meet. Then fold the narrow edge of corn husk over the seam and set in a loaf pan or dish that will keep your tamales upright. Continue until you have used all your masa mixture and filling (as original recipe is written, ~24 tamales).\",\"12. To a large pot or Dutch oven, add a steamer basket. Fill pot with water until it almost touches the base of the steamer basket. Then add the tamales, keeping them upright if possible (see photo).\",\"13. Turn heat to high, then, once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer to steam the tamales for about 1 hour. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re done when the masa appears cooked.

Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like\u00a0this one from Weck. Often the coconut milk is separated, so once added to the jar, whisk to get it completely smooth.\",\"3. Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics. Stir until creamy and smooth, pushing the probiotic up against the side with your spoon to evenly disperse.\",\"4. Cover the mixture with cheesecloth (or a very thin, clean dish towel \u2013 something that lets air in but keeps bugs out) and secure with a rubber band.\",\"5. Let the yogurt activate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours (sometimes longer \u2013 48 hours is my sweet spot for thickness and tang) in a warm place. The longer it rests, the tangier the yogurt will become. In warmer climates and summer, it\u2019s easy to make yogurt if your house is warm (75 degrees F \/ 23 C and above). But in cooler climates or seasons, place the yogurt in the oven with the light on (do not turn on the oven), where it should have the right amount of heat to activate.\",\"6. Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)!\",\"7. NOTE: For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more as as any excess liquid strains to the bottom.\",\"8. To make the mango pur\u00e9e, add cubed mango and orange juice to a small blender or food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Add desired amount of mango pur\u00e9e (we used about half of the prepared amount) to your yogurt along with the vanilla and whisk\/stir to combine (this is most easily done in a mixing bowl). Taste and adjust flavor as needed. (Reserve any leftover mango pur\u00e9e for serving with yogurt or for smoothies.)\",\"9. Enjoy immediately or place back in refrigerator to thicken for at least 4-6 hours (which we prefer). Store covered in the refrigerator for several days (mine kept for 7 days). You\u2019ll know it\u2019s gone bad when the smell is off-putting or there is mold.\",\"10.

Then open and pour into a clean, sterilized, dry glass jar or bowl. You can easily sterilize clean jars by rinsing throughly with boiling water and letting dry completely. Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like\u00a0this one from Weck. Sometimes the coconut milk is separated, so after adding it to the jar, I stir with a whisk to get it completely smooth.\",\"3. Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics.

Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)! For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, then loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more.\",\"7.

Make sure that you are using clean surfaces and utensils and are washing your hands throughout the process of preparing your kimchi in order to prevent introducing bad bacteria and disrupting the fermentation process. The photos provide step-by-step instructions, so if you get lost, refer back to those.\",\"2. Start by quartering your well-rinsed and dried cabbage (savoy or napa) and carefully removing the bottom core (hard white section) with a sharp knife. Discard.\",\"3. Next place your cabbage in a large mixing bowl and begin packing a generous amount of sea salt in between each of the leaves. Do so by lifting each individual leaf and sprinkling with sea salt. Repeat until all leaves have been salted. Then press down and let rest for 30 minutes. This softens and breaks down the cabbage, drawing out moisture, priming it to be coated in the sauce.\",\"4. While your cabbage rests, prepare your vegan fish sauce by adding all ingredients to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Set aside.\",\"5. Next, prepare your chili sauce by adding fresh ginger, garlic, onion and red chili flake to a food processor or blender. I started with 1\/2 cup chili flake and found it to be quite spicy (as I prefer). So if you desire less heat, start at 3-4 Tbsp and work your way up (amounts as original recipe is written \/\/ adjust if altering batch size). Taste and adjust flavor as needed.\",\"6. Add vegan fish sauce to this mixture and pulse to combine. Set aside.\",\"7. At this time, your cabbage should be ready to flip. Wash your hands and turn each section of cabbage over so it\u2019s facing the opposite direction. Then pack down with hands to compress. You\u2019ll repeat this process 3 more times (for a total of 4 times), waiting 30 minutes in between, and washing hands before touching cabbage.\",\"8. In the meantime, add your chopped carrots and green onion (optional) to a medium mixing bowl, along with the sauce. Stir to combine, then cover and set aside.\",\"9. While waiting, this is a good time to sterilize your storage containers. Bring a pot of water to a boil and place your containers (I used 1 large mason jar, and 1 small glass container \/\/ as original recipe is written \/\/ adjust if altering batch size), in a clean sink and pour the boiling water over top. Let containers cool slightly, then dry with a clean towel and set aside.\",\"10. Once you have flipped your cabbage 4 times (it should be tender and shrunken down quite a bit), it\u2019s time to rinse. In very cold water, rinse each section of cabbage to remove excess salt, then place on 2-3 absorbent clean towels and pat dry. Also separate the cabbage leaves at this time, so they\u2019re easier to work with.\",\"11. Rinse and dry the mixing bowl the cabbage was in, then return the dried cabbage to the bowl. Get your sauce with carrots and green onions and begin coating each leaf with the sauce. If you have gloves (disposable or rubber), use them at this time as the sauce can irritate sensitive hands (I didn\u2019t, but thought it was worth mentioning).\",\"12. Be generous when coating, but also keep in mind you need enough sauce to coat all of the cabbage. Once the cabbage is thoroughly coated with sauce, wash hands and get your sterilized storage container(s).\",\"13. With clean hands, begin placing the coated cabbage leaves in the container, packing down to ensure there is as little air as possible between leaves. Continue until all cabbage is packed in, then press down very firmly to remove air. Top with clean, sterilized lid, and set in a cool dark place (such as a cabinet, not the refrigerator) to ferment.\",\"14. How long to ferment is up to you. The resource I used suggested 36 hours minimum, then transfer to the refrigerator for 1 week to ferment longer. I fermented mine for about 48 hours, but next time I think I\u2019ll do 1 week for softer cabbage and a more intense fermented flavor.\",\"15. The longer you ferment the kimchi, the tangier and intense the flavor will be, and the more tender the cabbage will become. From what I\u2019ve read, I wouldn\u2019t ferment for more than 21 days.\",\"16. Each day it ferments, open up and press down with a clean utensil, such as a spoon, to press out air bubbles and ensure the kimchi is immersed in liquid. A good sign of proper fermentation is seeing little bubbles in the sauce when you press down.\",\"17. A good indicator of when it\u2019s done fermenting is the smell.

Note: If the batter dances around when it hits the pan the pan is too hot. It's better to go slower at a lower temperature with crepes.\",\"3. Let the crepe cook until the top no longer looks wet and the edges are starting to curl up, about 2-3 minutes. Gently flip by loosening the edges of the crepe first then sliding the spatula under the crepe. Cook an additional 1 1\/2 - 2 minutes, or until the bottom side is cooked. Repeat with the remaining batter, spraying the pan with oil between each crepe. Let the crepes cool to room temperature or wrap and store in the fridge until ready to use.\",\"4. To make the cream: blend all the ingredients in a blender until smooth and emulsified, about 30 seconds on high.\",\"5. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until fully chilled.

Put the first crepe onto a cardboard round or a flat plate and then put about 3-4 tablespoons of whipped cream on the crepe. Use an offset spatula to spread to just before the edge of the crepe. Place a crepe on top and repeat with adding cream and crepes until you've used up all of your crepes.\",\"8. Spread a layer of cream on top and decorate as desired. Refrigerate the crepe cake for about 1 hour before slicing into and serving.

Meanwhile add the reduced and cold aquafaba to the bowl of a stand mixer along with the cream of tartar. Whisk by hand with the whisk attachment until slightly frothy, then hook up and turn the mixer on a medium speed.\",\"4. Back to the sugar syrup, remove the lid (using the lid helps any sugar crystals on the side of the pot dissolve into the mixture) and set up a candy thermometer so it isn't touching the bottom of the pot. Watch the temperature carefully until it gets to 234 \u00baF (112 \u00baC) then turn up the stand mixer to high so that the aquafaba forms stiff peaks. You can turn up the heat to medium if you are careful and keep a close eye on the temperature.\",\"5. As soon as the sugar syrup reaches 248 \u00baF (120 \u00baC) it's ready to be added to the aquafaba meringue. At this point the meringue should have formed stiff peaks, which means that the meringue that clings to the whisk when removed will stay in a thin upright peak when inverted. If you invert the whole bowl over your head it shouldn't slide or budge a centimeter.\",\"6. When the syrup is at the edge of the firm and hard ball stages at 248 \u00baF and the meringue has reached stiff peaks, keep your mixer on high and slowly drizzle in the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to aim between the whisk and the edge of the bowl to keep the sugar syrup from splattering. Be careful as the sugar syrup is VERY hot. Pour the entire syrup into the meringue. The meringue will increase in size as the syrup is added.\",\"7. When all the syrup is added switch to a paddle attachment and turn it on to high. Let the mixture beat until it has fully cooled down. It should feel cool to the touch. You can speed up this process by placing an ice pack underneath the bowl if the shape of your mixer allows.\",\"8. Do not add the fat before the meringue has COMPLETELY cooled down. Once cool, leave the mixer at a high speed and very slowly add in the fat, just a spoonful at a time, letting it incorporate before adding the next spoon. If you do this slowly and all your ingredients are cold everything should work out fine (note: it's normal to lose volume when you add fat, but it thickens up as more fat is added). However, it can happen that the mixture breaks and looks curdled. Do not give up, keep adding the fat and it should come back together. It may need to be chilled if it doesn't come back together after adding the fat, so stick everything (bowl and paddle attachment) into the fridge to chill for several minutes before trying again.\",\"9. When your buttercream is thick and fluffy and all the fat has been added, turn the speed of the mixer down to medium and while running add in the vanilla extract. Then, with the mixer still running, slowly pour in the strawberry sauce. Start with 3\/4 cups of sauce and add more to taste and desired color is reached.\",\"10. At this point the buttercream can be used to frost a cake. If you want the frosting to firm up a little before decorating place in the fridge to chill and firm checking every several minutes. Once it's chilled sufficiently take it out and use to frost chilled cakes.\",\"11. If you want to make the buttercream in advance, you can refrigerate or freeze the frosting before the strawberry sauce is added.

Let the chocolate sauce cool until it runs easily and thickly off of a spoon, then pour the chocolate sauce into drips along the edge of the frosted and chilled cake using a spoon. Once you've made all your dips pour additional sauce to cover the top of the cake, spreading using an offset spatula and gently tipping the cake. To make a spiral design: let chocolate cool slightly and firm up, then place the tip of the spatula in the center of the cake and spin the cake slowly around while letting the spatula slide outwards as it rotates.\",\"15.

This takes 10 minutes with my stand mixer but could take longer on yours, and will take more time with a handheld electric mixer. You cannot over whip aquafaba, and if you do this too far in advance and it starts to deflate you can rewhip it back up to stiff peaks at any time.\",\"5. Prepare 2 parchment lined baking sheets, and make sure the oven is preheated to 350 \u00baF before beginning.\",\"6. In a large bowl, mix together the shredded coconut, almond flour, salt, and extracts you are using with a wooden spoon or a silicon spatula. Then stir in the condensed milk until it coats everything. At this point if you squeeze some of the mixture it will stick together but otherwise it does not tend to hold together.\",\"7. Take a large scoop of the whipped aquafaba (about 1\/4-1\/3 of the mixture), and using a silicon spatula, gently fold the aquafaba to incorporate it evenly in the coconut mixture. This step will help ensure more of the air stays trapped in the whip.\",\"8. Once mixed evenly add the remainder of the whipped aquafaba and gently fold that in.\",\"9. On a parchment lined baking sheet scoop 1 1\/2\\\" (walnut sized) balls. You can either form them with your hands, or using a cookie scoop. Leave the balls rougher around the edges for more a uneven golden effect, or smooth them in your hands for a more evenly browned look. Place them on the baking sheets about 2\\\" apart.\",\"10. Bake for 25-30 minutes, checking towards the end, until you have reached your desired level of golden. I like to bake mine bold for more caramel rich flavor.\",\"11. Leave to cool completely, they will continue to firm as they cool. If you are dipping in chocolate, chilling the cooled cookies in the fridge will help make them a bit sturdier.\",\"12. Take each cookie and set it in the melted chocolate, and using a spoon or spatula, help lift it out from underneath the cookie so it doesn't get stuck in the chocolate. Alternatively, you can spoon some chocolate onto the bottom of each cookie.\",\"13. Place chocolate dipped cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet, and set in the fridge until chocolate is set, 30-60 minutes.\",\"14. Chilled the cookies should keep about a week, but they don't last that long in our house!\"]","recipe_id":6369,"serving":"~30 cookies","time":"1 hour 15 minutes","title":"Vegan Chocolate Bottomed Coconut Macaroons","total_fat":null},"1596":{"calories":null,"carbs":null,"category":"1.India+South America+South Asia <Main ingredients: cumin\/coriander\/cilantro\/lime\/avocado\/onion>","image":"https:\/\/www.thecuriouschickpea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/DSC_0547-e1534441711896.jpg","ingredients":"[1 large cauliflower, cut into florets, 1 tbsp oil, 2 tsp curry powder, 1\/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp coconut oil, 1\/2 large onion, diced (~1\/2 cup), 2 cloves garlic, minced, 1 serrano pepper, seeded for less heat, minced, 2 tsp curry powder, 1\/2 tsp turmeric, 1\/4 tsp paprika, 1\/8 tsp cinnamon, 3 cups (28 oz can) chickpeas, rinsed, 1 1\/2 cups (15 oz can) coconut milk, 1 tsp salt, or to taste, freshly ground black pepper, 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice, or to taste, basmati rice, for serving]","link":"https:\/\/www.thecuriouschickpea.com\/golden-chickpeas-curried-cauliflower\/","pk":6374,"protein":null,"recipe":"[\"1.
